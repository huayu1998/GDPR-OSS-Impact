Asking names when this is not needed go against GDPR spirit
(Art 5.c: ""data minimization""), and since FAS do not ask that, it
is hard to argue we need the information.

This is also a problems for people having more than 1 name,
or people having just 1
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononymous_person#Modern_times ).

There is also people who do not want to give their name for whatever reasons,
and who could do that before with FAS.

Finally, since the information is requested by default without opt-out, someone
who would change last name or first name will be forced to change it in FAS, thus adding
to the burden of name change. In the western world, that mean mostly
woman and/or trans people. So not having opt-out do not get in a direction
of simplifying their life, which seems to not go in favor of diversity.

imfile: fix internal error when a rotated file is being modified

The inotify 'wd' descriptor was never deleted, causing an internal error

modified.

Signed-off-by: Renaud Métrich <rmetrich@redhat.com>

imfile: fix state files leaking (Issue #4494)

There were two issues with the current code:
1. the state file being deleted upon imfile vanishing was not the state
   file with 'file_id'
2. when a imfile was renamed (e.g. after a rotation), the file was
   flagged with 'in_move' which resulted in the state file to never be
   destroyed

The state file was not destroyed because of the following sequence:
1. imfile is renamed, a IN_MOVED_FROM event is fired and 'in_move' flag set
2. polltree executes and finds the imfile is gone, hence deletes it
3. due to having 'in_move' flag, the state file isn't destroyed

The new code gets rid off 'in_move' flag completely, because it is
useless: upon file renaming, polltree will detect that file vanished and
will delete the entry after flushing.
The old code was anyway unreliable in the case more than 1 file was
being renamed in a given directory simultaneously: since polltree
executed as soon as first notification IN_MOVED_FROM was received, it
deleted the entry for the other files being renamed as well before the
'in_move' flag could have been set.

The new code is enabled by setting new boolean 'InotifyNewBehaviour' to
'true', the default remaining 'false'.

- statefile.directory: the directory where statefiles should be stored.
Tests:
- dynstats-persist.sh

- It takes a ""raw version"" number from the package registry and turns it into a simple version number.

Creating the `Dependency` type

- The `Dependency` type represents dependency objects.
- Attributes are: name, version and attached dependencies.
- Using an interface as we need a self reference.

Fetching child packages as part of the `/package` endpoint

- Creating a recursive function to retrieve entire dependency branches.
- Each cycle makes a network call.
- Each cycle creates a number of new cycles based on the list of dependencies found.
- The function returns when the ""bottom dependency"" is hit, meaning when we reach a node that does not have any dependency.

XML special chars handeling

Fine tune to the agent's lib/app-sheet and lib/writeToXML files to avoid project hang when special chars were sent to store to XML. More cases might need to be detected.

Returning of Lineage, new DPO Qlik application  and a few additional tune ups

Final version before pull request. Overall changes are:
- new DPO Qlik app, built to help data privacy officers track data breach via exports and information where data sits. This application depends of 2 newly added extensions: DataReach and swr-sense-navigation.zip (fine tuned to accept up to 5 actions)
- Updated script parsing to recognize new LIB Connect statement
- Updated DataLineage extension to latest version with improved performance and hover gui
- corrected issue that would send illigal chars to the XML files generation
- recreates the userAccess folder structure (in case these were included in a manual delete)
- script parsing will also look into C:\ProgramData\Qlik\Sense\Log\Script by default to ensure non migrated to ArchivedLogs scripts are taken in account
- updated both Governance QVD Generator and Governance Dashboard for Qlik Sense applications to reflect the changes above
- squashed a bug that made users information in Governance Dashboard for Qlik Sense applications to be misrepresented
