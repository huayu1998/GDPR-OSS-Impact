Firstly, it really frustrates me to see security vulnerabilities (however serious) to be publicly reported without even attempting to go the secure channels that Apache has in place. All vulnerabilities should be disclosed through https://www.apache.org/security/

Secondly, I'm not so sure if this is actually a security issue. `cordova-serve` is a development tool, so any process that access to this (or an attacker that can gain access to this) would already be able to execute commands without through to `cordova-serve`. See https://github.com/apache/cordova-serve/issues/36#issuecomment-649066476

Nonetheless, I still think it's a good idea to close behaviour that is obviously not intended. I've tested this fork locally and tests are passing.

This change should not be called a security fix, because we do not consider this to be a security vulnerability.

The name of the contributing developer or organization should not appear in the title.

The name of the actual human author, preferably with valid email address, should appear as the author in any commits that we would consider merging.

The proposal seems to be in multiple commits. Considering the relatively small size, I think we should consider merging in a single squash commit.

I think a title such as ""avoid external code execution"" would be much better.

It LGTM  and I think it's a very good idea. Current terms and conditions need the user created as they are implemented as a user action. But for sure you have to change the import to `jakarta` or it won't compile in main now (it's our fault for not reviewing it sooner).

Please rebase the branch to put PR changes on top of current main and modify the import. Also squash the commits into a singe one once the PR is being reviewed.

I have a doubt about if we usually modify the `registration` flow in upgrades (for existing realms). I have checked a bit and I think the answer is no. The old flows remain as it were before. Nevertheless I will ask to the team and I'll confirm you the next week.

Have a nice weekend!

This is not ready to me merged yet, and it has quite a way to go before it can:

- The global quota should not be managed by the XMPP server, but via configuration.
- The global quota is a delicate issue in and by itself: it allows a single user with lots of bandwidth to cause lots of churn on the entire thing and make files of other users be deleted.
- The quota implementation as it is is not at all multitasking safe (while the upload implementation is). This is a hard requirement, because the duration of an upload is determined by the speed of the client, and thus xhu must be able to run in multiple threads, coroutine tasks (possibly in the future) and/or processes concurrently. Simply decorating the thing with a few locks won’t do (due to multiprocessing), this needs to be solved on the file-system level.
- The quota implementation is O(n) in the number of uploaded files.

In general, I think that quota data needs to be stored to reduce the complexity of the quota check (from O(n) to O(1)). For this, a file which stores the current quota use per scope (scopes are ``global`` and one for each user) and which is read and updated using a file-level lock (``flock``; reading can use a shared lock, updating needs an exclusive lock). The update must be rolled back properly when the upload aborts etc.

(``flock``s don’t work properly with threads though.)

**suggestion:** Overall, I think it would be better to keep this form a) _anonymous_ and b) _optional_. Opening a new tab after installing or removing the extension is already a bit intrusive but I'm also in favor of keeping this flow. However, including form elements for user input like name and email could easily discourage users from considering filling out any inputs on the form.

If we still want to collect other user data like name and email, I'd vote for making it more clear that this data a) is _optional_ and b) only used in case a user is interested in hearing back from us for this specific submission. Even better, we could only show this form when a specific checkbox option is selected as it doesn't make sense for some options like _I prefer my local development_.

In terms of UX, I think we can improve a) the messaging, b) the tone of voice, and c) the checkbox options. Also, the text input elements introduced here could use better spacing (padding).

**thought**: A better alternative could be to proactively introduce help links where possible under each checkbox option or below the form. For example, linking directly to the screencasts, relevant documentation, etc. Many users still don't fully understand what dev environments are and this is a good opportunity for us to provide educational content or even suggest scheduling a call for help as included in the Free Trial email we're sending out.

Last but not least, we could use this PR only to fix #1009 and discuss this in a follow-up issue. 🏀
