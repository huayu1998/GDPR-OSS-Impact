Very cool!

I like the idea here of not actually deleting tasks from the DB and instead hiding them! This is what a lot of real-world applications do. However, if you're ever doing this in a real job you have to be very careful. Different countries have different laws about data actually being deleted from the database when the customer requests it to be removed. This is especially true if you have in users in the EU because of [GDPR](https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/an-introduction-to-the-gdpr/).

An alternative here would be to delete the if-block and instead use a try/except that looked for any key errors on the `request_body`.

One way you may consider refactoring your code is to make it so that the `os.environ.get`s are only called once when your app is initialized instead of every time a task is completed.

Shouldn't we re-attempt partial writes? (the case where `w < toWrite`)?

Partial write may not be due to an unrecoverable error.

`fn` sounds like `function`, how about `file_name`?

Should we use a subdir?

For very large tables, `JSON_C_TO_STRING_PLAIN ` may be more efficient.

I'd do this in a bg-thread. This can potentially cause unwanted latency spikes in log-event processing.

iirc, this can get called from multiple threads. I think you want to lock the bucker for processing increment and comparision.

Also, `persistStateInterval` is being compared to a counter here. This can lead to a cascading failure (is a DoS attack vector) when there is sudden surge in log-messages that causes several writes going in back to back, degrading file-IO in general, potentially leading to back-pressure on other buffered-writes due to dirty-page threshold being hit.

I'd base persist on time (time-interval) not event-count.

If it must be based on event-count, I'd atleast introduce a min-time threshold such that persist is never issued within the threshold-interval of previous persist.

We have an exclusive lock at this point, atomic-add does not seem necessary.

Also, the impl doesn't look atomic, so at this point the name seems misleading.

But I think we should use atomic-persist here.

How about we write this to a temp-file (in the same dir) and then `rename` it to desired file-name?

While `open` with `truncate` and `write` is not an atomic operations, `rename` is wrt the new-name.

This does not belong here. I think you want to put this in `dynstats_newBucket`. Loading it here would artificially bump the counters `n - 1` times, where `n` is the number of `dyn_inc` call-site initialization(s). So if counter `foo` has value `10` and we have 3 sites, we'd end up with value 30 (instead of 10).

yes, that sounds good.

We do already have the ability for user specify a working directory already, so do we still need it?

yes. 

I think this depends on whether we think the re-attempt should occur right away, or on the next attempt to persist as specified by the user. Do you think that is sufficient, or we should be more proactive on this?

ok

I think it can make sense to permit different locations other than the global work dir - sometimes it makes sense to split different state info for easier management. But if I understood @janmejay correctly, he is suggesting to think about a subdir under the work dir.

Ok, perhaps we can add a subdir like 'dynstats' underneath the global work dir. 

Add an assertion that assures us bucket_stats_name hasn't truncated the name? In such a case we may end up with conflicting (duplicate) counter-names.

The comment above says we return an error in case we are unable to find / read the file, but we don't seem to be returning error. Is this intentional? If so I think we should update the comment.

Shall we move this to `finalize_it:` with a null-check?

I don't quite understand the difference between these two yet, perhaps by the time I have read thru the change it'll be clear, but since it is difficult to guess, I think it may be better to use self-documenting names.

`loadPersistedState` would probably be a better name.

Similarly to the suggestion above, `dynstats_loadPersistedState` would probably be more appropriate name.

We seem to return error (atleast according to the comment), but we don't check it here. Do you want to add a check?

I think this returns -1 on error, do we need to check?

Please add `sync` and handle error similar to `write`.

Or document the fact that we do not make it durable.

Content can be pretty big, are you sure you want to log it? Perhaps we should settle for the first few 100 bytes?

Let us handle spurious wake-ups.

Should we have `destroyFileWriteTask` function instead and just call it here? 

Aren't we supposed to free `name` and `content` too?

Perhaps we should create a `destroyFileWriteTask` function that is used to free task?

We have an unbounded queue here. This can cause unbounded memory growth? Isn't it better to use a ring and overwrite old content in favor of new when file-writer can't keep up?

This is only necessary when `work_q.size == 1` right? Shall we wrap a check around this?

All of these need to be error checked.

I'd prefer a `stopFlush` flag on `dynstats_buckets_t` and pass it in to `fileWriteWorker` and have it check terminate condition on that.

In general, it is better for all components in the codebase to be modular. If we ever need dynamic stop/start of components, or need to turn something off on the fly for debugging etc, modular design would allow us to call destroy and rest assured everything has been shutdown (regardless of global shutdown state).

Let us avoid using global flags such as this one as far as possible.

A simple alternative is to flip the flag on `dynstats_buckets_t` in `destroyFileWriteWorker` or `dynstats_destroyAllBuckets` etc.

In favor of modularity, I think we should fold these into `dynstats_buckets_t` too.

Error check is missing.

Error check missing.

Null, errno check missing.

Error check.

Error check.

Let us name functions a little bit better. If dynstats ever gets another background worker, this name will make things confusing. 

Perhaps `dumpStats` or `writeStats` or something that describes its purpose better?

Retry write `[w, toWrite)` instead? If `w < 0` I guess it makes sense to use failure path, but `w >= 0` doesn't necessarily imply a failure.

Also, we need to error-check this.

As the failure-path below points out, incomplete writes can be troublesome. 

Why not write to a tmp path (in the same dir), sync it and then move it to the expected destination?

If update is lost, we'd have the old file, if it becomes durable, we'd have the new file. We are ok in both cases.

In case of partial-failure in write, we can just kill the new file (which is a tmp-file anyway, so no harm done).

Aren't we supposed to put `jval` and `json_bucket_values` too?

This looks like invalid memory access.

Given `jstr` above is `const char*` I presume it is tied to `json`.
And you just free'ed `json` here. So worker would end up performing illegal memory access when it reads `content`, won't it?

just set `shouldPersist` to condition in this `if`?

We need a better name for this. `persist_state_interval` doesn't really help one understand what this field is used for.

Aren't we supposed to hold bucket-lock for this?

Better name and a short comment describing what this is would be very helpful.

Looks like this can race with destroy, destroy actually kills the lock and bucket.

`task->content` is the invalid access I talk about in context of `put(json)`.

I think we're safe, as we actually make a copy of the content here: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/74a1d45d26d4b1a8bcb90b62af8fc1ddc97086b5/runtime/dynstats.c#L1074

since we just copy the json content string to the task structure, that is why we immediately free it here. So no need to keep it around.

yes, looking back, the idea was to snap to the imfile config naming convention: https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/imfile.html#persiststateinterval
are you ok with leaving the configuration name as `persistStateInterval` ? We could perhaps rename the variable to something like `persistStateWriteCountInterval` or something similar?


if the state file is not loaded, we consider it a normal condition, thus it is not checked. we already log something inside the function, so didn't think it was worth adding another log or similar here.

not really needed, as `dynstats_openStateFile` can fail meaning statefile data couldn't load, perhaps it doesn't exist, or was deleted for some reason. We should still continue to operate normally.

Yes, the initial idea for this feature, was simply to back up the counts, in the way imfile backs up the file positions. This way, at least if rsyslog is restarted normally, the counts are not reset. 

Making this feature completely durable, seems to add lots of overhead, which we could add, but does it make sense to make it configurable? If so, i'd like to push that as a future enhancement?

we are also directly calling `destroyFileWriteWorker` when `dynstats_destroyAllBuckets` is called, but agree, we can just add `stopFlush` instead of using the global shutdown state.

https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/74a1d45d26d4b1a8bcb90b62af8fc1ddc97086b5/runtime/dynstats.c#L596-L598

I meant `GetTime`

We should perhaps ignore `ENOENT` (just generate a log message) but IMO all other errors should be checked / bubbled up.

Not fully durable impl is ok.
Configurable durability is ok too.
Since we are doing this in a different thread, I thought the overhead of `sync` wouldn't really be a problem.
I think its ok either way, but we should definitely document the behavior inline and in user facing documentation of dynstats.

Yes, makes sense. Sorry for the false alarm.

Yes, sorry about the false alarm.

yes, great catch. I'm moving all instances of writers prior to destroy. added some asserts into this function to confirm as well.

This plugin could swing between being useful to unusable depending on how difficult this is to setup.

An alternative would be adapters for Maxmind files and allow users to implement adapters for other data sources.

Any GDPR concerns that should be mentioned?

It looks like we could bundle the plugin with a [GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) database if we need to make it work out of the box. This is a smaller, less accurate free version of their GeoIP database product. The full product requires a license and subscription to use.

I think most of the GDPR rules generally apply to data at rest, i.e., logs, customer records etc. It should be OK to use this data right away in a live website, but it might be problematic to generate logs of who was visiting from where. But if a site logs IP addresses, they could run geoip offline later anyway.

I think using this library has caused problems with the fusion build system since it imports a file from disk (or something like that, I don't recall the details but I think it causes our builds to print out ""Warning: custom Babel config is an unstable API and may be not be supported in future releases. Use at your own risk."").

It seems like [node-geoip](https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip) is the most popular JS library for interfacing with the maxmind database. Unfortunately this library requires transforming the database from the maxmind format but says it has better performance. I'm not sure if this is a good time to try migrating to this library.

If there's a benchmark that demonstrates node-geoip is faster, I'm fine with using that. Otherwise, I think it should be OK to use maxmind-db-reader in the near term. We can fork it and/or send a PR upstream to fix the warning.

Remove this (it's debuging code)

Rewrite to use entity properties instead of ctools relationships

I guess this will disapear when we switch to properties.

This comment doesn't look right to me.

This is not a constructor and not fake?

switch to properties?

@yanniboi  is there a reason that these are split into two different plugins?

@yanniboi This looks like it would be really useful elsewhere but not here if we're switching to properties. Is there any other need for this that I am missing?

You'll get an array of IDs that can be iterated over.

This will make the task fail if you cannot update the user. Is this intended? From the other error handling, I assume we'd like to continue and only add the user ID to the deleted users if we could update.

That's a nice suggestion as well. At first, I decided against this method, as it requires reading the complete file at once for the processing. Depending on the size, the other solution might be better for very large files. But since we don't expect _that_ large files, I think this aspect is not worth keeping. Therefore, I changed the implementation according to your suggestion.

Next, one could consider changing the way we interact with database objects. Performance-wise, the current implementation has many drawbacks: For each (valid) line in the text file, we have one `SELECT` and one `UPDATE` query. We could also change this to use query all user IDs at once (i.e., with an `ExternalUser.where()` clause) or even using `update_all`. I refrained from doing so, since I wanted to focus on error-free processing and catch all errors that occur. For the bulk-operation, I am currently not aware of a suitable mechanism to identify those user IDs that were not used to fetch a record.

Indeed, that's true: The task would fail. While I wouldn't expect that a user update cannot be performed, I agree that another error handling would be more suitable. Therefore, I changed it accordingly.

very interesting / possible tension with earlier proposal? 

I think scenario here is quite important - company collection of data from: 

- their own workers 
- their independent providers / contractors 
- workers for another company, or some other captive / compelled population 
- consumers of their products 

these are all currently different types of data providers, and while it may not be necessary at this point, I think elucidating the difference between these scenarios and the data collected in each one might help address some conflicting perspectives (i.e. remunerate people for their data, but move away from service-for-data business model) - kate

possible connection to labor intelligence / coop-supporting institute proposal - kate

possible tension between this view and later proposal from DSC Wiesbaden re: commercial payment of data providers? I see the proper valuation / remuneration of data being a big topic, and the concern raised by the authors here re: vulnerable populations is quite valid. - kate

This seems to be asking for an exchange standard, not a legislation.

If we let humanity live on in the mine field of an unregulated Internet, then we need to spend billions in educating the teachers so that they actually know what they are talking about.

This is not an accurate description on how the big 5 became monopolies. - lynx

DiEM is not in government, therefore it should not confuse electorate with ""preliminary"" steps. It should promote the long-term vision for fair technology that doesn't suck. Proprietary technology should not be legal for any societally critical applications. - lynx

Copyright abolition would not solve this problem. Content goes viral using one specific URL and whoever has that copy makes all the money. Still, the idea of going back to ""broadcast"" is very good and the way to achieve could be to (a) make it mandatory to distribute websites by multicast pubsub instead of HTTP (see https://secushare.org/pubsub or IPFS for that), (b) make targeted advertising illegal and (c) introduce a mandatory anonymous micropayment system by which *any* article can be bought anonymously for a few cents. See https://taler.net for the most promising payment system in that regard. - lynx

Yes, and forbid proprietary code in all societally essential systems, therefore giving any programmer on Earth a decent chance to find vulnerabilities by reading *source code* rather than disassembling machine code. - lynx

Oh yeah! We need funding to *create* a truly distributed and private social network. None of the existing softwares can actually replace Facebook *technically*. In most cases they are just yet another server you have to trust. See https://secushare.org - lynx

Why? And is it enough if it is just a right and not an obligation? For the defense of democracy it probably must be mandatory to anonymise or at least pseudonymise digital activity. - lynx

This can actually be solved technically and should be mandated by law. See https://youbroketheinternet.org/programme for details. - lynx

Spare a few details that are too detailed you just pretty accurately described the GNUnet/secushare project.  <3  The YBTI proposals for legislation aim at obtaining this kind of Internet instead of the current borken one. Instead of asking money to be spent in making this system we recommend to make it a necessary requirement so that the entire industry MUST work on solving this challenge: the challenge for an ethically acceptable Internet. - lynx

Breaking up the monopolists would need to be repeated yearly as the digital market tends to recreate new monopolists. The best way to prevent trading of data is to not let anyone *have* any data to trade ‚Äî otherwise trade will happen, either legally or in the darknet, simply because the data is there and there is no evidence of it being abused or stolen. - lynx

This assumes GDPR actually achieves the goal. See https://youbroketheinternet.org/GDPR for a criticism why GDPR may in large part fail to actually achieve the intended goals. - lynx

For single tests, it is OK if they skip when the tool is not available.

Hello @rgerhards - I am finishing changes now that will fall back to old way of getting pid from pidfile when `fuser` command is not available. Would that be ok? My thinking here was that when `fuser` is available, we should use it, because it makes the test stronger.

sorry for the late reply - I was swamped with quite some things due to the Corona crisis. I am now re-reviewing.

Yes, if we fall back to the old way, that would be ok. The important thing is that everything continues as before on platforms where fuser is not present (else we will effectively reduce platform coverage).

I think it would make sense to put this common code into a function.

in the case of non-priv drop, this now writes the pid file earlier than before. That can cause races in some exotic situations. I know the chance is slim, but I remember cases where we had this in the testbench, for example.

Hi @rgerhards - I agree that a function makes sense here, and will push that change shortly.

Thank you @rgerhards - apologies for delays on my side as well, these are interesting times. I will refresh my memory on this code path and look at what should be done. It would be interesting to understand that race condition better too. Do you happen to recall which testbench test caused the race?

I have pushed this change, with one more fix for the non-priv drop code path mentioned pending.

Hello @rgerhards - hope you are well. Sorry for the delay, but I have pushed a change that puts the non-priv drop parts of the code path back the way it was. Thank you.

Can you change the use of the quotes in this and the line above to `""...['...']);""` please? Python is nice to allow alternating quoting style, so we can avoid to use backslashes in most cases.

Are the backslashes needed?

I find the ""This is disabled by default."" a bit confusing. What do you think about ""(default: :const:`True`)."", wouldn't that be easier to understand.

Similar in the paragraph above (I know, that's not your fault): I'm not sure if that says, the value is `True` (i.e. `disable_cookies`) or `False` (option `disable_cookies` is not enabled) by default. :roll_eyes: 

Isn't there a simpler way? Doesn't Matomo already provide a default opt-out form?

In the end, you need to set 3 things (plus all the markup and styling) to make the consent form work. I understand it works together with the JavaScript code above. Yet still, I think it would be great to be able to pull in something that is readily available from Matomo. Just in case the implementation changes, then the API that allows to pull in that feature may still remain stable. Could be. 

Changed in e50b247a87aa1ccc0a091daef417a97ea004345a

Removed backslashes in e50b247a87aa1ccc0a091daef417a97ea004345a

Changed documentation text in e50b247a87aa1ccc0a091daef417a97ea004345a

Yes, Matomo provides an opt-out form. But as far as I understood the concept of ""Ask for consent"", it is quite independent to the idea of the opt-out form.

With the opt-out form you are tracked until you opt-out (obviously).
With asking for consent, you are not tracked until you deliberately accept the tracking. Therefore, a user/visitor interaction is needed. 

In my opinion, this is the easiest way to implement that feature. The user of django-analytical just has to insert two buttons to his consent request box with these id's.

What I'm worried about is that this may be already ""too difficult"" for a lot of average Django users. You know, developers are spoiled, they want to plug an app in and see it working. :see_no_evil: :grimacing: 

Seriously, the buttons are not the problem, the styling and overall user experience is. (""How should this thing of 'consent or no' look like?"", ""Where do I place the buttons?"", ""Do I make them disappear once they are clicked?"", etc.)

Don't you think this is challenging for some developers? Or they'd come up with mediocre results (and people start re-iterating the ""Wordpress is much better"" :smirk:, because Wordpress plugin are designed to have a ready-to-use plug-and-play developer experience).

Can we solve this issue? Matomo doesn't provide anything we can just pull in, does it? Or do the Matomo docs provide a UX design example? (I didn't find any.)

Ah, we could provide a template tag for inserting the two buttons, can't we? Wouldn't that be nicer than plain instructions in the docs? This would cancel out mistakes like spelling the DOM element ID wrongly. :bulb: 

What do you think?

I can understand your concern regarding usability. Nevertheless, I don't want to constrain the flexibility to implement the consent buttons as the user wants. I thought one of the reasons users choose Django over Wordpress is that they have more flexibility. Correct me if that's not the case ;)

Unfortunately, Matomo does not provide any HTML consent buttons. See: [https://developer.matomo.org/guides/tracking-javascript-guide#asking-for-consent](url)

The idea for a template tag is very good. I would implement it with a start and end tag, like this:

`{ piwik_allow }
<button>Track me!</button>
{ end_piwik_allow }`

You may ask: why not just one tag which uses under the hood a HTML button?
For most of the cases buttons might suffice. But sometimes you want to have a clickable image, or a font-awesome icon. To preserve flexibility the tag should be able to use arbitrary HTML elements inside of it.

`{ piwik_deny }
<i fa-2x fa-cross></i>
{ end_piwik_deny }`

Is this a possible solution or is it then again too complex?

EDIT: I'm fairly new to programming template tags. Is it possible to create template tag which can be used like this:

`<i { piwik_deny } fa-2x fa-cross></i>` -> `<i id=""piwik_deny_consent"" fa-2x fa-cross></i>`

That would make things much easier. In the end it would not differ that much from the original solution üòÅ

I think the latter is a particularly good idea! And, yes, it's certainly possible (take a look at the [built-in template tags](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/builtins/) for reference).

The [simple_tag](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/custom-template-tags/#writing-custom-template-tags) can have arguments, so our API may look like this:

```django
{ piwik_allow }  yields just  id=""...""  (as in your example)
```
```django
{ piwik_allow button }  yields  <button id=""..."">Allow</button>  (localized)
```
```django
{ piwik_allow button ""Sure!"" }  yields  <button id=""..."">Sure!</button>
```
```django
{ piwik_deny div }  yields  <div id=""..."">Deny</div>  (just like <button>)
```
```django
{ piwik_deny i ""fa-2x fa-cross"" }  yields  <i id=""..."" fa-2x fa-cross></i>
```
Just allow a few ones. Depending on the to-be-generated HTML tag you validate and use arguments 2+ the appropriate way (e.g. use parameter 3 for `class=""...""` or so, if that's really needed).

That looks sufficiently clean, doesn't it? How do you like it? :smiley: 

I have implemented it like you proposed, but now I have doubts.

I like the idea but it's maybe problematic that sometimes the template tag returns fully fledged HTML and sometimes it returns just an id.

Also, there are many edge cases, like what if a user wants to set the ""type"" attribute of an `input` element, or the user leaves out some parameters. This means I have to enhance the template tag further, and validate the input, etc.

Furthermore, now the user writes
`{% piwik_remember_consent ""button"" ""Please track me!"" ""buttonClass"" %}`
instead of 
`<button {% piwik_remember_consent %} class=""buttonClass"">Track me!</button>`

In my opinion, this is even more difficult to use, in case you don't know template tags very well.

I would go with a simple template tag: the user builds his own HTML and attaches the id with the tag. This would keep the template tag function slim and coherent and gives the whole flexibility to the user, while we do not have to worry about edge cases.

What do you think?

Sure, the usage you prefer would still be the default. Hence, I wouldn't worry.

The ""button"" & friends, on the other hand, I see as nice idioms: You say, _""Don't give me just _something_, which helps me to construct a consent UI control: Give me a button!""_

Note that I wouldn't use quotes for writing _""button""_, e.g.
```django
{% piwik_remember_consent button %}
```
You have the full freedom with the simple tag and get a nice, of course modified but idiomatic, result with additional parameters.

Let's get another opinion on board, though: @jcassee, what do you think?

Don't worry too much about edge cases, btw. It's fine when the short idiomatic solutions only cover the principal use cases.

From the [docs you linked](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/tracking-javascript-guide#step-3-user-gives-consent), it seems only `_paq.push(['rememberConsentGiven']);` is required?

I would be okay with folding the contents of these variables into one. Their content is only used together.

No real reason not to support poor souls forced to use IE, right? Replace with old-school `function () { ... }`?

First of all: I doubt that pushing the event to Piwik is the _only_ thing the consent buttons need to do. They probably also need to close a dialog or fixed banner. Depending on the JS tech used, you need the tag id to integrate with other interactions. This make me think that using classes is better than using the ids.

I liked the different options offered in this thread, but the original one still seems simplest (using a class):
```html
<button class=""big green piwik_give_consent"">I agree!</button>
```

I implemented it now as @jcassee proposed because I think it makes most sense in this way and doesn't get to convoluted. Please check the new version and let me know if there is something missing to get this pull request merged.

Thanks for the fast and nice collaboration, I really enjoyed my first PR :)

This still says, `PIWIK` in the constant name. Shouldn't it say `MATOMO`?

Can't we remove the documentation for Piwiki all together, maybe just showing a hint on the new location and the reason for it? I don't think it makes sense to continue to maintain, let alone extend, it.

Here is the missing newline that causes Flake8 to fail.

We should really just keep the Piwik implementation as is. Not extend it.

I'm not even sure if it would work. There is no Piwik that does consent. It's only Matomo that does it.

Same here: Why add code and tests for an obsolete integration?

Actually, this code shouldn't go here at all. As mentioned by my other comments.

Why did you overwrite that method and removed some values?

Agreed, will change that.

Sorry, it was a long day. Yes, same apiType in request and sync methods. I will remove the default in the other clause and switch positions here.

Mollie API / Klarna is very strict on the phone number format. I'm not sure if an automatic transformation is a good idea when it comes to the payment process. So I removed the phone numbers altogether, Klarna will ask for them at a later stage if necessary.

Addiontally, GDPR makes it difficult to pass this information, IMHO.

From the GDPR point of view, the shipping address and the e-mail should be removed as well

Right, but they are necessary for the Orders API. Phone number is not. So I think a shop provider could argue with Article 6 here.

Indeed, sorry about that. Hopefully this won't be propagated higher up in function call trees. I'll have to check that.

Upper in existing call trees, `ZoneCommand.run()` will now return `(stdout, stderr)` instead of `(retcode, stdout, stderr)` too. Shouldn't be an issue, the class is not documented, and the method has obviously never been used. - or it would have failed.

I had a look at the functions that return a `stdout, stderr` pair overall ceph. There has been no effort to have consistent return values in the API, but most functions return either `returncode, stdout, stderr` or `stdout, stderr, returncode`:

I'll stick to that and change `return (stdout, stderr)` to `return (0, stdout, stderr)`.

could oyu please annotate the function declaration like so?

```python
    def run(self, cmd: str) -> Tuple[int, str, str]:
```

Sure, most other functions are not statically typed, so I hadn't noticed that.

yeah, we should add those annotations eventually indeed.

@sebastian-philipp this change causes make check to fail. Perhaps we should leave the function without typing for now, and then add typing in for every function in a later PR?

yes, exactly.

I suggest to replace this by ```if (cnfparamvals[i].val.d.n)``` and discard the global work variables bCompatJsonString as it seems to be used only for this temporary case.

I doubt you can get GDPR settings if the ""shuup.gdpr"" is not in installed apps.

You really can't call `basket.billing_address` here https://github.com/shuup/shuup/blob/master/shuup/core/basket/objects.py#L271? Usually these private attributes should not be called outside the class.

Why exactly you are saving these addresses since there is no changes?

Maybe something like this would look nicer.

1. you do not need type check
2. you should deal gdpr settings if gdpr is installed
```
contact, user = None
if not self.request.person and has_installed(""shuup.gdpr""):
    from shuup.gdpr.models import GDPRSettings

basket.orderer = (self.request.person or contact)
basket.customer = (self.request.customer or contact)
basket.creator = (self.request.user or user)
```

Only import GDPRSettings if installed.

Should we raise here if there is no email since not in all installations email is required for address. Maybe GDPR checkouts as guest should have but likely email being None here is a problem.

Well under gdpr app we do not need to check whether it is installed. Likely the enabled check should also be under `create_user_consent_for_all_documents` not sure this check needs to be added either. Maybe instead of this line should just be `reate_user_consent_for_all_documents(request.shop, order.orderer.user)`.

Missing license header for this new file.

You could check the user and customer fields here as well and also check the email/username matches to what we expect.

So by guest ordering I can update anyones user information and disable the account if I know their email?

Maybe `order.creator` since not sure someone can add consent behalf of someone else since here order can be created by staff as well.

should we do the flight recorder post before this one?

we should probably expand a bit on how this is explicitly opt-in for embedders and how we're only using it in VSMac today and not on any random user binaries that are executed with mono-project.com packages.

Every `one` _engineer_ who has to suffer `from`...

_The_ Modern software lifecycle...

...conversation can give _a developer_ a lot of information

I'd stay away from such politically charged tone here.
You can make the point that some user can be averse to tracking and can find telemetry to be such one of those.
Plus, you can say that the EU passed GDPR as a response to such concerns.

Avoid the self congratulatory tone. You can say the same without using it.

This phrase is confusing. How about:
```
More important than having our code open-source is to have good policies around privacy-preserving data collection. One of those polices, is on collecting Personally Identifying Information (PII).
```

We don't need to drop the GDPR hammer all over the place, it distracts people making them thing it's something to pay attention while reading your post.

You propose the question of what's PII, but don't answer it. The part about not collecting file paths and code in stack traces are awesome examples of doing so.

```
What's PII and how does it apply to bug reports? PII is any bla bla data that can be used to identify bla bla bla.
When it comes to bugs, it shows up in places like file path bla bla bla. Another important place are stack traces because bla bla bla.
```

What desire?

`Mono already has unique hashing functions for metadata objects; we use it inside of the AOT compiler and runtime.`
This fits better as part of answering that the solution is hashing. IE:

````
The solution to this is to generate a hash that is identical for two ...., while uploading ... - Mono already has such hash functions for metadata objects as our AOT compiler uses them
```


Why do we expose these abstract state machines? It's not clear what's the connection with the previous paragraph.



It's hard to make the connection of state machines, logging and flight recorders.
Maybe explain that the concrete way we realize those state machines is through logging and flight recorders. Plus give some high level overview (a few words) of what a flight recorder is. IE:

`Flight recorder is the name we give to lightweight logging doing using a circular buffer`  - or what you feel it's appropriate to mention here.

Yes, we must make it clear that this is completely opt-in and the place we enabled has user consent.

Not sure about the dismissive tone of `spending less time teaching customers to debug.`

I think this should be configurable so you can preserve date ranges (e.g. year or quarter, month etc)?

If it's a base class, should it be `abstract`?

`title` should also be randomised as it implies gender which is identifiable.

Why archive as a sanitiser?

Surely `$max_length` should be passed into `$rand->string()`?

A 4 character random password is not a good idea...

It's a shame Drupal 8's components aren't available separately :(

While there is currently only an implementation of this in Prosody, I don‚Äôt see why we should rely on only prosody being used on the other side.

This allows a client to provide an arbitrary quota, or leave out the ``q`` entirely, or set it to 0 to delete all files uploaded so far. The quota needs to be part of the HMAC instead.

Don‚Äôt make assumptions about the directory structure.

This should also take into account the size of the uploaded file. The amount of data used must still be below the quota even after the upload.

It also needs to handle the case where the file is larger than the quota allows for: in that case, the upload should be refused without any files being deleted.

From my reading, this sums the files of all users. 

Also this is O(n) in the number of stored files, which I don‚Äôt like at all. This must be condensed into an O(1) operation.

See the main review comment for details.

I prefer to log to standard output and have the service manager deal with it. Alternatively, support systemd journal (optionally) directly. Configuring and managing log directories is a PITA, and always opens up the question of logrotate.

>  I don‚Äôt see why we should rely on only prosody being used on the other side

I'm using Prosody and I'm trying to get something working and running sooner rather than later.
I understand that you'd rather prefer less coupled and more generic solutions.

Yes, very good point.

> set it to 0 to delete all files uploaded so far

A quota of 0 means that no files get deleted. But that's also a potential avenue of attack.

> This should also take into account the size of the uploaded file. The amount of data used must still be below the quota even after the upload.

> It also needs to handle the case where the file is larger than the quota allows for: in that case, the upload should be refused without any files being deleted.

Depends on whether you're enforcing a hard quota or a soft quota. I'm OK with usage slightly going over the quota. Prosody already enforces file size via `http_upload_external_file_size_limit`.


> Don‚Äôt make assumptions about the directory structure.

I don't yet see how I can do it otherwise. Putting storage usage in a file like you suggested provides some decoupling, but you still need to know what files to remove.

> I prefer to log to standard output and have the service manager deal with it.

What service manager are you talking about here? I use Circus to run the processes, but I don't see my logs ending up in its log, so I'm not sure what you mean.

Do we need to prefix with `gdpr_` on our page?

`FormattableMarkup` please

Can you not grab bundles off of `$definition`? That surprises me...

Rather than duplicating the table code, you could do a count first and then inside the foreach handle the wrapper.

Possibly swinging the other way from by previous comment about things in the collector, but should the collector be doing filtering?

`FormattableMarkup` please

Although this is how it's structured in D7, I'm wondering if we'd be better having the filename defined per bundle, rather than on relationships? It does limit you in that you can't have the same bundle put into different files depending on the relationships, but that has issues if the same entity is applicable via multiple relationships (it will only appear in one file which may not be obvious)...

I think @jamieaa64 was suggesting we should actually go the other way and only explicitly include relationships. It's worse if we include data we shouldn't (i.e. data disclosure) than if miss data that should be included (i.e. incomplete fulfilment of SAR). Probably also worth trying to steer clear of double negatives as they just get confusing from both a UX and DX point of view.

We could combine this and the above into a single relationship field. It's never both, so could do something with constants. Can then have specific positive methods that do the comparison (e.g. `isOwner`, `followRelationship`).

Wouldn't all of this be better in `__construct` than in the create? Not even sure the benefit of a create here as we're not having to do things like container injection or similar.

Should probably also have `$entity_type_id` set against the field...

Do we have a general concept of enabled on fields? Config entities (which are at the entity level for us) can have a status, but if a config is disabled, we wouldn't pull the fields from it so wouldn't ever get to this stage...

When would this get used? I feel like we always deal with bundles...

Can we clean this up while we're here - don't need namespacing on global function as we shouldn't be defining them. Also, unless I've misunderstood the data structure, can we not just return (if set) `$this->bundles[$bundle][$field_name]` rather than all this array filtering?

Let's mention how they are keyed.

Let's mention how they are keyed.

I think keying them by something like `$bundle.$field` might be helpful?

Might be nice to have some structure, perhaps a `GdprTraversalResultInterface` which SARs and removal can implement? Can be documented as `@return GdprTraversalResultInterface[][]`... Might be for a future iteration though!

Or perhaps even a single `GdprTraversalResultInterface` which has an iterator and methods to access things by entity type etc... Just more thoughts...

Am I right in thinking this method actually does a recursive traversal? Naming is possible confusing...

If we use something like a `GdprTraversalResult` we can simplify the arguments a lot!

Let's not load more information until we need it, save memory and time. The next few statements exclude various possible scenarios, so do those first.

Do we need this as the previous block of code returns if it's not? I've a feeling IDEs can handle that..?

Perhaps it'd be better to have something that can be put in the entity annotation to always exclude an entity type? I know there are others that will end up like this (e.g. bookkeeping stuff when we do that).

Do we need to store the whole entity, or can we just use the ID? Although a reference to an existing object wont take up much memory, but may make debugging progress much more difficult...

Let's inject the config storage and use that rather than static calls.

As we already have our field config which is built making use of the available field definitions, can we use that as our basis? As we've moved towards explicit inclusion, we don't need to worry about un-configured fields. A simple `$entity->hasField($field_name)` call will protect against out of date configuration (or checking the result of `$entity->getFieldDefinition($field_name)`.

Similar question of whether `enabled` should exist or means anything in D8...

Let's not get the referenced entities until after exclusion checks as it will load all the entities etc which is time/resource intensive.

I would perform this check once, outside the `foreach`. It also needs to check whether we are trying to keep the same filename, as if we are not we should use pass in NULL. If we've got it outside the loop, we could do something a bit more consice like:

```php
$passed_row_id = (SINGLE_CARDINALITY && FILE_NAME_MATCHES) ? $row_id : NULL;
foreach ($referenced_entities as $child_entity) {
  $this->doTraversalRecursive($child_entity, $progress, $passed_row_id, $results);
}
```

If you query on a field without specifying a property, it will use the `::mainProperty`, which for ER is 'target_id'. I think let's let it handle that itself, as an extending class may use a different property name...

We don't want to pass `$row_id` in for owner relationships as we have to assume they are multiple cardinality.

Also, do we need to pass in the field config so SARs can get the filename?

From this being empty I'm assuming this would never be used directly, in which case let's make it an `abstract` class/method.

`enabled` again - let's get consensus and adjust everywhere as required.

This actually looks like a good candidate for full caching rather than just statically. The cache can get reset when field config entities are updated.

Not everything uses bundles, so I would start by checking that and avoid loading storage etc.

Do we still need this now we are not using the ctools dependency? I'm assuming those classes will become ineffective...

s/Entity/Entity type and use `$this->t()` (also in the other places).

Not sure if the form is the right place for the options to live... Perhaps a static method on the entity class?

Same here...

Worth using separate submit handlers rather than checking `#name`? That's probably more ""The Drupal Way<sup>TM</sup>""

Are these meant to be route parameters, or should it be the query key in the options argument?

Would it be better to have each form element call `$request->get(...)`? This approach will mean if you add something, you'll have to remember to add it here as well...

I think the entity builders should be able to handle all of this.

Also, this looks like `GdprFieldConfigEntity` is too complex... Perhaps we should make it so you can set values straight on the field, which handles writing back to the config entity. That way the entity builder can do something more like:

```php
$config->getField($bundle, $field_name)
  ->setRta()
  ->setRtf()
  ...;
```

Let's get rid of static calls! We're going to need to do some good test coverage of this and statics make it difficult.

If we're consistently having to do this load or create, we could extend the storage handler to have a `get($entity_type)` which would handle load vs create internally. Or even just do that directly in `::load()`.

![](http://s.quickmeme.com/img/fe/fe05577986250c85a9df4c46dbf46afb33332155da3e0f590cfd99bf5259b1dd.jpg)


We can build the fields with a default value and set `#access` to `FALSE` and it will pass through the value (I know this is copying my code, bad me!)

Also as mentioned previously we want to only follow explicitly and remove the double negative...

Once we change to a single setting configuring relationships, can we change to something like:

Title:
> How should this relationship be treated?

Options:
> - Do not follow this relationship.
> - This %entity_type_label owns the referenced %target_entity_label
> - This %entity_type_label is owned by the referenced %target_entity_type_label

Description:
> Owned entities are included in any task which contains the owner.

Title:
> Right to access filename

Description:
> Specify the filename for the <em>owned</em> entity to go in. Use %inherit to keep the related entity in the same file.

`%inherit` being `<inherit>` - which is a new feature to add into the SARs traverser as well.

We can move away from this being a static.

In a form, it's generally recommended to use `$this->t()`

We can take a look at the entity keys for the type and exclude a number of them, certainly uuid and bundle (and id we treat as delete the whole entity).

If this is to generate an empty option, that should be handled by setting `'#required' => TRUE`.

Should probably search the name as well as label.

You can create links directly from a route and text (as in you don't need `Url`).

I wonder if it would be better if we actually pass back a set of `GdprField`s and they have an easy way to get all the data - better than arrays where nothing is well defined...

Can we move this into the `GdprField` itself, can pass the field definition in to it...

I wonder if `getKeys` is too broad, for example `User::$name` is a key (I think) and the `label` key shouldn't make something un-editable.

Ooo this should DEFINITELY be a service, though maybe this MR does enough in one go already!

Hmm... where is this called from? It looks like the `gdpr_tasks.rta_traversal` service actually already handles all of this, in which case things calling this should probably call the service directly?

If we keep this, I'd be inclined to make it a one liner `return \Drupal::service('gdpr_tasks.rta_traversal')->traverse($user);`

I think this should be pulling from the generated CSVs at this stage?

This should probably be in the entity builder rather than the template preprocess, assuming it can be done quickly enough at render time.

What does the anonymizer need `@database` for? That seems a bit of a smell...

Can we make this actually link to the right page?

We probably need to also add in a `$result['deletions']` so they can happen inside the transaction.

s/RTF/RTA

Do we need this if we are building the CSVs first? Can we just render the CSVs like we do in D7? This could be quite intensive at run time on a large system...

If we are using `$this->assets`, can we clear it at the end as well?

Unfortunately it's not quite as simple as this, as the filename is based on the source, which could be an entity reference on another entity or an owner on this entity... In D7 I was also passing around the source plugin :'(

Perhaps one solution to this would be to use a [non shared service](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/shared.html) (so each call creates a new instance). Then we can use properties on the object much more safely. That may make the whole arguments stuff much simple and could have a source stack or similar to track where we are and how things relate.

At some point (probably follow up) it might be good to actually build the CSVs directly here rather than that being another loop over this data.

`image` and `file` both extend `entity_reference`, so I would be inclined to do a check of whether the item class is an instance of `EntityReferenceItem` (or `EntityReferenceItemList` if we have the list) and the target type is `file`.

`elseif` for all other instance of entity references which does `""{$entity->label()} [{$entity->id()}]""` or just `$entity->id()` if there is no label/it's the same as the id.

We need to deal with multiple cardinality here and loop over the field item list. Same for generic ER below.

Should we use `FieldItemListInterface::view` here as we can handle HTML markup?

This _may_ not be sufficient as the entity may not have a suitable edit form with for this particular field, but let's come back to that...

This needs to not happen directly in here as this is outside of the transaction.

Is `private` suitable, just wondering how likely this is to extended...

Probably `private` is better for that very reason :P

I've moved this to the collector. 

No. I'd kept the naming of these fields the same as the d7 version for consistency. Would you prefer I change them?

No, you can't :(

I think it's OK for the collector to do the filtering, although I'm not sure Collector it still the best name for it anymore as all the traversal stuff has been moved out. It's basically now just used for building viewdata for the UI. 

Done

I used a factory method for the explicit case where the GdprField is being created from an array of values used by the screen. The constructor just takes the bare minimum for the instance to function (eg in `GdprFieldConfigEntity::getField`). I've now merged the constructor and the create method, and I've added the entity type ID.

Enabled is tied to the ""This is a GDPR field"" checkbox. I've removed the concept of ""configured"" and only left ""enabled"" in place.

It's used when we traverse reverse relationships. We have to find all GDPR fields in the system regardless of entity or bundle that link to a particular entity type. 

I didn't add the namespacing when I created this, maybe it was done by the brainsum team? I've removed it again. Yes, the array filtering is no longer necessary now that we've moved to using bundle & field name as the array keys. I've cleaned that up.

Done

They're querystring parameters, but they still end up on the querystring this way as they don't match any of the route params. Would you prefer this to be explicit?

Sorry I'm not sure I understand. This method is used by the controller to extract the filters from the querystring, so we don't have access to the elements when it's used.

This is a static method that's called by a hook so can't inject things here :(

I'd prefer to keep `GdprField` as a fairly dumb DTO that doesn't have a dependency on it's parent `GdprFieldConfigEntity`. 

What I'll do instead is change this method to create and pass in a `GdprField` which will clean it up a bit, allow us to use method chaining but still leave it dumb. 

Let me know what you think and I can change it again if you prefer. 

Done

This is a static method called by a hook, so can't use `$this->t` here. 

I'm not sure what `inherit` is referring to here. @yanniboi can you take a look at this one?

It need to stay static as it's called from the static `buildFormFields` method,  which doesn't have access to the collector. Also, it doesn't use any of the collector's data so no need for it to be an instance method. 

Done

Yes it is to generate an empty option. I did this as setting the field to `required` means you can't submit the form if Anonymize isn't selected (as this dropdown is hidden). Is there another way around this?

Done

Fixed

Leaving this for now as it has an impact on the GdprFieldSettingsForm. Should come back to this.

This was a temporary implementation. @yanniboi's changes handle removing this method and transition to the queue worker.

Looks like this comment is copy/paste from `EntityTraversalContainerInjectionInterface`. Can it be updated to be specific to this task? 

Can we assign this to a variable before returning it? That way we can add a `/* @var */` comment to help the IDE when performing a find usages. 

Can we reword this? Maybe ""Creates an instance of the traversal for this specific entity"" would be better.

Remove reference to `handleEntity` as it doesn't exist within this interface (or add a note that it should be implemented in inheritors of `EntityTraversal`)

Do we want this check here? This means you can't ever call `traverse` twice on the same entity. If there is ever a situation where you want to traverse, then modify the entity based on results, then traverse again then that won't work. 

Should we just hard-code an array of known keys for now? 

üëç That's a much better place for this.

Can we use `$field->getType() == 'entity_reference'` instead of `$entity->{$field_id} instanceof EntityReferenceFieldItemList` for consistency with the other traversal classes?

Can we use `$field->getType() == 'entity_reference'` instead of `$entity->{$field_id} instanceof EntityReferenceFieldItemList` for consistency with the other traversal classes?

Is there a reason to use `->getString()` rather than `->view()` here? Or will that cause problems if it returns markup?

I like the updated traversal!

The function doc block `@return` statement should deal with that, but sure if it helps.

I'm not sure we want multiple traversals. If we did we could provide a default `$force = FALSE` parameter. @andrewbelcher ?

@andrewbelcher ?

Is that going to work? I think getType will return 'file' or 'image' etc depending on what type of field it is, even though they are both entity reference fields...

Yup. `view()` returns a render array and could be anything. `getString()` is safe. We probably will want to extend it at some point to have the ability to alter values, but its a good starting point.

Hmm, I thought it returned entity_reference when I was testing this before. I might be wrong though üòÖ 

I think if you want to re-do it you can instantiate a new traverser - all the getter methods call `$this->traverse()` to ensure the data has been processed.

I think a hardcoded set of keys is fine. From memory, I would suggest:

- `id`
- `uuid`
- `revision`
- `bundle`
- `language`
- `status`?
- `uid`?

Thinks of any others that are mega important?

Mouse wheel delta is a positive value or a negative value depending on which way the user is scrolling, but it's also linear. I need to use a logarithm in order for the scaling to feel linear when you scroll (i.e., scrolling one tick inwards should move you from 0.5x to 0.4x, but having the same movement scroll you from 1.5x to 1.6x would feel inconsistent). Finally, the min and max are so that the user can't scroll too far in either direction.

yes

You should add a brief comment explaining why this calculation is necessary

+1, you've got several magic numbers and exponents that could use explaining.

Good declarative comment

Can we document the class properties? At least lets stick in the classes so that IDE's can tell what it is we are working with.

Similarly the rest of the Anonymizer methods. Can we add `@param` and `@doc` definitions to the docblocks?

Thanks - that's my C# background coming through! 

@yanniboi Yes, I can add those. What's the convention for where to apply doc blocks usually? I assumed it was for public/protected members, but not private.

Regarding the IDE, it can already tell without the docblocks on the fields as it picks it up form the type hints on the constructor parameters used to initialize the fields. 

Done.

Done.

Done.

@JeremySkinner the convention in Drupal is to document everything. If nothing else, it makes it easier for other developers in the team to read and understand what's going on.

Also, generally I would use `protected` rather than private unless there is a specific reason why we'd need this to be the final implementation/use of it. Generally the convention is to assume that people could extend these classes if they required unless there are specific reasons not to (e.g. security).

Thank you again @yjyao!


please don't say sorry. i didn't mean to micromanage but i think it'd be easier to keep conversations to their threads (which means i shouldn't be replying right now). right now we have too many threads discussing too many things and it's becoming hard to track.

I'd say using `\maketitle` here would be easier for later, but it isn't too big an issue to fix later. So if everything else gets addressed except this, I'd say just merge and I'll clean it up in the class one.

I may have donked up the .gitignore.  I was just trying to add the libreoffice lock to it so I could read without git giving me back-chat. Feel free to remove anything that's a pain.

perhaps set `\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}` at some point? I think you're talking about the indents due to starting paragraphs. Should normal paragraphs be indented? Or should nothing be?

It'd be easier if you could, as some of us don't have the ability to edit your PR. Though @yjyao or @Giebisch could come to the rescue.

What package is this? I can't find it on CNET, unless I'm being an idiot (very possible). 

It looks like you're suggesting a unified .sty file. That's a good idea.

The current styles don't match, so we have a number of options:

1. Manually copy those parts we want to match (I'm not sure what a 'tramline' is, but I suppose I could find it and make mine match other documents)
2. Have a unified style file, all of which are numbered, as required by the GDPR document.
3. Have some toggle saying 'this is a contract' or 'this is not a contract', which then changes the formatting on its own.
4. Have some separate .sty file, which contains only common elements, such as tramlines.

What do you think?

I just think that it's off.

The first line *in this instance only* should not be indented, but be in-line with the second line.

Please let me know if you would like for me to clarify



This is fixed in 3a40e212afe7085d039a on my branch.

>1. Manually copy those parts we want to match (I'm not sure what a 'tramline' is, but I suppose I could find it and make mine match other documents)

The tramline are the two lines above and below the document title:

The GDPR document does not have standard numbering

Hope this helps!

I'm sorry, @passamo9, for being a bit thick right now. But could you perhaps circle which exact line you do not want indented, and put that image here? Then we can add a `\noindent` on that line and see if that clears it up.

I think this has been fixed by replacing the title page entirely.

Fixed.

No worries! This one:

I made a new .sty file, because the existing ones already had ideas about sections and how to use them.

For the GDPR document, I redefined sections, subsections, and so on to look like normal text, so they could use and reference proper numbering automatically.

As mentioned elsewhere, perhaps a unified style file would be better?

We should probably get lawyer-input from @passamo9 about a specific number of styles for legal documents.  I don't know if it's good to have just one versatile style, or many bespoke style files.

Please add that style file to your PR. We're using them to address those points, discussed in #30. Once this gets merged, the idea is to work through everything and shift it into its own `.cls` or `.sty`.

Add a `\noindent` here

This doesn't look like it's addressed yet, though this isn't the right line for it. I'm pretty sure it should actually be discussing line 71. I opened a request for change there, so if this conversation could be carried on over there, that'd be great. Also thank you for the clarification! Really helpful)

This is just to help me remember the incredibly simplistic beauty of this solution.

i'm not sure whether this is a good idea, to write the entire document as a list of sections/subsections/etc. the source code does not appear particularly readable either. how do you compare this against your `points`?

@bond7o6 fixed in 36159179bcd03c24

I'm yet to decide; I feel the decision on how we structure everything is going to have to involve us, latex-y people, sitting down with the lawyer-y people and coming to some understanding. I just want to remind myself when that discussion happens that this is an option.

Sorry - major malfunction on my end. The .sty file is in now.

Fixed in e8fa78f61554f7a2b

@yjyao - the example file I was given had numbers before every point, so it seems natural to let the engine do this for a number of reasons:

1. Modification would become easy.
2. Any optional subsections would become easy (numbers don't need to be rechecked)
3. Reference becomes easy (with \labe{thing}).

Source-code readability, on the other hand, is important. I think I've been looking at raw latex so long I've lost the common perspective.

using enumerate-descendants also supports everything you pointed, plus you don't need to mess with the starred sections. but for this PR i guess it's okay as is.

items don't need braces.


I feel setting the `secnumdepth` is a more pure latex solution, which is nice. Though this should really be brought to #16.

can we add a TODO to clean up all the `\textbf`'s?

also these really need to be a (numbered) description list. maybe add a TODO for that too

can a subsubsection be indented?

s/section \ref/section~\ref/g

add a TODO for a notices env.

some clarity to this comment would be nice. While I agree with using `~` instead of ` `, the rest of this suggestion IMO decreases readability, not desired. 

Also perhaps change the `bf`s to emphasis. Handling this after the PR is fine though.

moving to #36 

what's ""the rest of this suggestion"" referring to?

`s/section \ref/section` and `\ref/g`. Not quite sure what that all does/means.

This looks like another time to ask @passamo9 or a lawyer for input. Either _italic_ or **bold** text isn't a problem, once we get a clear request on what standards should be, or if there are any legal requirements here (do laws refer to 'bold text' at any point?).

Fixed.

That's why handling this after the PR is probably best. We can then use and adapt emphasis to suit their needs.

How about just 'autoref', which will print 'section' (if it's a section) and 'subsection' (if it's a subsection), &c?

Also, I didn't see any emails printed here, and I assume it's important, or people would be legally obliged to correspond via snail-mail for security breaches, which I find personally horrifying.

I've added commands for emails already - @passamo9, perhaps you could confirm where emails should go. Somewhere after the titlepage perhaps?

@bond7o6 oh sorry. `s/section \ref/section~\ref/g` means ""substitute `section \ref` with `section~\ref` globally / in all occurences"" in sed. 

@Andonome in that case i'd suggest `cleveref` over `autoref`. wdyt? 

Oh, is that what they're on about? Yea, switch it to autoref and we'll discuss it in depth later.

I've never used 'cleveref', so I can't compare. I'm sure either's fine, but if you use 'cleveref', you should also remove the 'hyperref' package, as that's all I'm using it for.

moved to #37

ahhhh, my reliance on emacs is showing itself there). I 'think' hyperref is the preferred choice over cleverref, and autoref is a command within hyperref, not another package.

also moved this to #38 because it can be handled outside of the PR

let's add a TODO anyway so when we clean this up later we will remember to do that. @Andonome feel free to resolve after that's done.

@passamo9 is [small-caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_caps) ok here (and below), as opposed to all capital cases?

That looks great!

_Read the Docs*_

I feel as if this is a lot of decisions crammed into one paragraph. I think we could extract a couple of different things here:

1. Technical documentation;
2. Product documentation (now named general user information);
3. Way of working (or something like that, to include the `markdown` decision and where the documentation lives e.g. `/docs`);

This is a duplicate from `contributing.md`, might be better to have it in one place that we can link to each other? I can imagine that at some point we update this file, but not `contributing.md` and then the content might unintentionally differ. 

To quickly develop* 

This was pretty hard to read. Depending on the audience, it might help to use some easier terms and to shorten the sentences.

e.g. what does _registered or microservice in nature_ add to the message? (I'm not sure, but it might be making it more complex than need be).

Lower the dependencies* on eternal ... (?)

This paragraph is much easier to understand than the `Sources` one above.

What is the user component? Maybe link to it?

Cool.

How important (and relevant in this part of the documentation) is the _(and inline scripting save)_ part? Should it be added here?

Also, how relevant is the Security-wise... part in this section?

""The web gateway provides an easy way of providing applications with NL Design System token files, based on the current organisation. The application only needs to include `/api...` **before loading other css files**.""



_... all data request and ""there"" `doelbinding` to..._

I'm not sure, but I feel as if this ""there"" should be ""they're"" or ""their"". Either way, a hard to understand sentence.

Maybe something like: ""... all data requests and complies with `doelbinding` to a GDPR registry out-of-the-box...""? 

I'm unsure what it means üòõ  so maybe this feedback doesn't make sense 

caching* 
notification*  (?)



I'd probably try to structure these functionalities a bit more:

**Filtering by one field**
`endpoint.com?fields=field_name`

**Filtering by multiple fields**
`endpoint.com?fields=field_name,field_name_2,field_name_3`

**Filtering by multiple fields and subfields**
`endpoint.com?fields[]field_name.sub_field_name,field_name_2.sub_field_name`

Not sure if above is still correct, but something along those lines.

For this reason, => Therefore, 



In the frontend we stepped away from the label `Entities`. Now I think for the backend documentation we would probably still want to be using `Entities`. However, it might be worth noting that when someone works in both this could get very confusing.

Everywhere we referred to `web gateway` and not `Web Gateway`.

Kubernetes first link is missing.

I feel as if this is a prerequisites list that is buried in a paragraph. 

A lot of (good) information, all crammed into a paragraph. I'd suggest structuring it a bit more (multiple paragraphs, bullet lists, ...).

Feel as if this could be deleted.

Why is there a comment here?

I feel as if this might be the third duplicate of this paragraph.

I've some suggestions:

1. Check if GDPR protection is enabled and the user has approved its data collection;
2. Use the own browser's geolocation API before using an external service;
3. If the geolocation API fails, request to `geoip-db.com` as a fallback;
4. Verify the limits for commercial use off `geoip-db.com` -- despite Rocket.Chat and this client being MIT; 
5. The `fetch()` API has some options to properly do CORS requests;
6. The ipify functionally can be implemented on Rocket.Chat's Livechat API, decreasing the number of requests needed.

Thanks for the review, will update it accordingly

Let's create a specific file/helper to provide this method.

We need to define the service which will provide the geolocation data on the server side.
Hardcoding is not a good approach.

So this is going out to this api to grab location?  This has to definitely be optional if done at all.  Some serious privacy concerns around sending data like this out.

Same here

I think you forget to remove this code before pushing your changes.

This is a clone from the `userPresence` lib, you don't need a new lib to do the same things, it does not make sense.
You can do what you want by calling the new methods related to session stuff within the `userPresence` lib.
Please, remove this file and move the new methods to a `helper` lib.

Why call this method here?
We have a specific lib to deal with user status.

Why not just one method to update the livechat session? 
You just need one method, you can pass specific data as parameters.

We don't need this lib.

I don't usually like JS but this is pretty, nice one!

the data-toggle and data-target trigger the modal pop up to display, I could make so that there is a listener for these buttons instead but that seems to add unnecessary js code.

the username here used for authentication with mailchimp api  is completely optional so I just added something random.

Thanks so much for the comment, super informative and saves some stack overflow trawling.

Thanks for clarifying on that, agree it's preferable to a listener, however I was questioning what the effect will be - is it so that when someone clicks ""Open in Gmail"" they get a popup asking them to subscribe to the mailing list? Because that doesn't seem ideal and wouldn't capture people on mobile (for whom these buttons don't show, but make up a large chunk of the users).

Such as className, required, placeholder, etc.? Many fields have these properties so it'd be nice if they aren't repeated.

You could pull out the fields that don't match the ""Field"" prop types and then just use the spread operator for the rest. eg. `{errorTextInput, ...rest}` then `<Field component={errorTextInput} {...rest}/>`.

I think that's the syntax for the spread, I'm doing this without a linter so you'll have to let me know.

These can probably be migrated too, right?

`{this.showInstitutionBox}` seems hacky as well?

ü§î 

Does this require the empty blocks? I guess because it needs to be a React component to pass the type checking?

I thought about it, but I think the real intent behind this refactor is to remove the nested function calls to make things more composable, didn't see a real use for ""display components"" to be migrated away as yet

I agree that's the major selling point of this refactor, but having a `createXYZ` function that generates a component is basically just a constructor of a stateless component with extra steps and less readability.

Yes! We are passing in `Why Do you want to attend {event.name}?` to `ApplicationLabel`, and the use of `{event.name}` requires the surrounding text to be a React node - so I wrapped it in a Fragment, which is the intended use case anyway.

Oh good point! I forgot I was going to let the base inherit from JSX.InstrisicTypes (or whatever it's called) and pass the props down to allow things like aria tags to get on the fields

Should be 'unique key**s**'.
You can also put revision_id in as a unique key.

Doesn't need to be declared separately as it's already declared unique.

""Attached Entity""?

""Associated user""? Is this a revision-ed version of the field on the entity base table? Or supposed to be the creator of this revision? Or both?

This might want to be on the base table so that its easier to query it? Also index.

'id' should have an index assigned to it.

Is there any reason why this was done as a separate field type rather than using and Entity Reference behaviour plugin?

Would be better to store a date in ISO8601 format or similar.

Can we add descriptions to this column and 'user_id_accepted'. It's not clear what the two columns are for or how they differ. I was of the understanding that this would be a field on a user or agreeing party, so the reference to the agreeing party might already be present? Either way, some documentation on this relationship would be useful.

Add foreign keys (target_id, target_revision, user_id and user_id_accepted) and other indexes, particularly the user_id columns.

Exportable entities **do not work well** with revisions. If the consent agreement is ever marked as 'default' you will lose revision information on every cache clear.

Use the 'manage gdpr agreements' permission?

I don't understand what this is doing? $valid is always TRUE in this function.

This isn't supported by all the versions of PHP that drupal supposedly supports. empty can only have variables in it.

```php
  if ($values = $from_state['values'][$field]) {
```
Would be better.

This seems superfluous. Why is this being added?

Modifier le commentaire pour expliquer ce que fait cette migration; √† la mani√®re de  https://github.com/n7consulting/Incipio/blob/master/src/Migrations/Version20190105082511.php#L11

Je vois plusieurs probl√®mes avec cette requ√™te:

1. Naming: habituellement les fonctions findAllByX prennent X en argument. En regardant l'impl√©mentation, cette requ√™te devrait plutot s‚Äôappeler findAll
2. Probl√®me de performance √† venir avec cette fonction. Il faut utiliser une requ√™te SQL au lieu de cette boucle (qui posera des probl√®mes d√®s que le nombre de contact se mettra √† cro√Ætre).
3. Probl√®me de structure (ce qui explique 2). Cette fonction r√©cup√®re tous les contacts puis les retourne group√©s par alumnus. Tu peux obtenir exactement la m√™me chose en faisant un select sur les alumnus qui ont plus d'un contact + un join sur ces contacts. Le r√©sultat retourn√© sera exactement le m√™me que cette requete mais √©vitera le point 2.



M√™me remarques que pour `findAllByAlumnus`

Le manager registry doit √™tre r√©cup√©r√© depuis la classe, pas pass√© en param√®tre.

Exemple: https://github.com/n7consulting/Incipio/blob/master/src/Repository/Personne/MembreRepository.php#L31

Doit √™tre fait via une requete SQL et non une boucle.

Cette migration modifie des tables qui n'existent pas encore. Elle doit √™tre supprim√©e pour ne pas cr√©er d'erreurs comme https://github.com/n7consulting/Incipio/runs/4058979326?check_suite_focus=true#step:7:306


Corrig√© via edit perso de la PR.

Toutes les informations alumnis ne sont pas affich√©es lorsque l'on est sur la fiche d'un membre (URL: membres/voir/1).

Ca r√©duit l'utilisabilit√© s'il faut aller √©diter √† chaque fois que l'on souhaite consulter les informations alumnis.

De m√™me, il faudrait afficher les contacts alumnis (n'afficher le cadre alumni que s'il y a des contacts ou des infos almunis) sur la fiche d'un membre.

Erreur de copi√©-coll√© ?

Mauvaise layout. Celle-ci est celle du suivi de projet

Mauvaise layout. Celle-ci est celle du suivi de projet.

Il faut rajouter les infos alumnis & alumnis contact √† la partie RGPD.

Plus de d√©tails sur l'impl√©mentation disponible ici: https://github.com/n7consulting/Incipio/pull/238/files

En plus de modifier les templates pour inclure l'affichage des informations personnelles des alumnis,

Il faut annoter les champs contenant des infos personnelles avec l'annotation `@Groups({""gdpr""})` pour qu'ils soient inclus dans l'export.

L'ajout d'un bouton comme sur le pipeline de suivi d'√©tude n'est pas n√©cessaire (aucun action contextuelle suppl√©mentaire) et rend l'affichage moins lisible (car moins de lignes par √©cran).

Je partirais plut√¥t sur un simple lien vers la fiche de membre.

pas de maxsize d√©finie. Saisir un texte trop long g√©n√®re une erreur 500.

255 pour un titre est assez long.
128 devrait suffire.

Le champ est marqu√© nullable alors qu'il est required dans le formulaire. Autant ne pas le marquer comme nullable

Contenu est trop court. 255 caract√®res me semble tr√®s limit√©

Pareil qu'objet. Le champ n'a pas besoin d'etre nullable s'il est required dans le formulaire.

/!\ Attention aux migrations en cas d'√©dition

Pas besoin d'etre nullable.
Pas besoin d'etre si long quand les options propos√©es sont 'mail', 'telephone', 'physique', 'lettre'.

Au passage sur les moyens de contacts, vous pourriez peut √™tre ajout√© 'r√©seaux sociaux' pour couvrir les contacts via Linkedin

Cette classe n'est pas import√©e.

Concernant les FormHandler, faire une classe √† part enti√®re pour finalement si peu de validation et ne l'utiliser qu'√† un endroit est discutable. (le ratio complexit√© / b√©n√©fices me semble limit√©).

Le code comment√© doit √™tre supprim√©

Ca serait pratique d'avoir un lien vers la liste des contacts dans le breadcrumb

Ne pas afficher le lien si le champ est vide:

```suggestion
{% if alumnus.alumnus.lienLinkedIn %}
 <a href =""{{ alumnus.alumnus.lienLinkedIn }}"">{{  'rh.voir_profil'|trans({}, 'rh') }} </a>
{% endif %}
```

C'est un d√©tail, mais s√©mantiquement plus correct.

Il y a un bug dans la gestion des alumnis. Voici comment le reproduire.

 1. Ouvrir le profil d'un membre sans profil alumni.
 2. Modifier l'email
 3. Enregistrer

=> Le membre appara√Æt dans la liste des alumnis alors qu'aucune information alumni n'est renseign√©e.
A priori, un membre ne devrait apparaitre dans la liste des alumnis que si des informations alumnis sont renseign√©es.

Une meilleur option serait de ne pas cr√©er l'entit√© alumni si tous les champs sont nuls.
Et de garder l'ancienne requete.

Commentaire ne doit pas  √™tre annot√© `gdpr`. Sinon il se retrouvera dans l'export d'une personne.

Et d'exp√©rience, le contenu des commentaires est parfois tr√®s honn√™te; pas quelque chose que l'on veut partager. Enfin commentaire ne contient pas d'infos appartenant √† la personne. Donc l‚Äôanonymiser est parfait. mais l'exporter ne l'est pas.

Pourquoi est ce que certains sont mis √† null et d'autres √† `' '` ?

suggestion: renommer ce champ `membre` pour ne pas introduire de confusion

Ce champ doit √™tre annot√© `@Groups({""gdpr""})` pour que l'export soit √©galement appliqu√© sur `Alumnus`

See 74eafd543bc9efe4e33290c7837c62a2c55844ed

See 74eafd543bc9efe4e33290c7837c62a2c55844ed
Also change `access.html.twig` template
The `if` condition is a bit cumbersome but still maintainable with only 3 attributes.
Is it normal that on the `access.html.twig` template I can access non-gdpr attributes from `alumnus` class‚ÄØ?

I think this could be more generic. rather than having to pass every field in as a separate parameter. $bundle and $field_name are still good to force as they are necessary for any update.
```
  public function setField($bundle, $field_name, $values) {

    $values['bundle'] = $bundle;
    $values['name'] = $field_name;

    foreach ($values as $key => $value) {
      $this->bundles[$bundle][$field_name][$key] = $value;

```

This way we can pass anything in with values, either less than all fields or add more fields without having to change the function.

I think, we can set the date to ""now"" for the translated posts and get rid of the `last_edited` until we actually edit something in this version.

If you want, we can list you as a translator here. 

For that, please add yourself to [this file](https://github.com/datenanfragen/website/blob/master/config/_default/params.toml). You need to specify a short and a long name (the long name can optionally include a link to a website/social media profile/your GitHub account/etc. if you want).

You of course don't need to use your real name, pseudonyms or user names are also absolutely fine.

For now, you would then add your name to the `authors` array but at some point, I'm planning to have a separate `translators` array that I'd move you to, then.

You don't need to copy the images that are not language-specific. Hugo automatically shares the images between the different language versions of a post.

Please also translate this text.

        payload: { ids: selectedIds },
```

```suggestion
                label=""resources.users_media.image""
```

And then you have to add the translation to translation files. e.g:
```yaml
    users_media: {
      name: ""Medien"",
      image: ""Bild"",
      fields: {
```

```suggestion
                    return translate(
                      ""resources.users_media.preview_unavailable""
                    );
```

And also a translation:
```yaml
    users_media: {
      name: ""Medien"",
      image: ""Bild"",
      preview_unavailable: ""Vorschau nicht verf√ºgbar"",
      fields: {
```

Or something like this:

```suggestion
                  return (
                    <Tooltip title={data[""title""]}>
                      <Avatar
                        src={data[""imgURL""]}
                        onClick={() => window.open(data[""downloadURL""])}
                        variant=""square""
                      >
                        <BrokenImageIcon />
                      </Avatar>
                    </Tooltip>
                  );
```
With this fallback image:
```js
import BrokenImageIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/BrokenImage"";
```
Doc: https://mui.com/components/avatars/

Tooltip:
```js
import { Tooltip } from ""@material-ui/core"";
```

In this case I would set `imgURL` to `null` if it is not an image. Otherwise `Avatar` would try to download / show the ""not image"" and creates a 404 request.
```js
                    imgURL: record.media_type.startsWith(""image"")
                      ? `${localStorage.getItem(
                          ""base_url""
                        )}/_matrix/media/v1/thumbnail/${localStorage.getItem(
                          ""home_server""
                        )}/${record.media_id}?width=50&height=50&method=crop`
                      : null,
```

The `Tooltip` text:
```js
                    title: record.media_type.startsWith(""image"")
                      ? record.upload_name
                      : translate(""resources.users_media.preview_unavailable""),
