Sometimes, you don't want to just rely on the `atexit` handler, but manually shut down the `AsyncTransport` in your application and be sure all the logs are flushed from it. Calling `.flush(); .stop()` is not ideal, because `flush` could block for an unnecessarily long time. This PR:

* sets the stop event in `_Worker.stop`, so the queue begins processing immediately
* removes `_Worker._export_pending_data`, which became redundant, and just uses `stop` as the atexit handler
* Exposes a public `stop` method on `AsyncTransport`
* Driveby: clarify `grace_period` and `wait_period` units in docstring

Problem:

In the func `_maybe_adjust` we have this condition
where `if not p['would_adjust']: continue` which
would get triggered before `if p['pg_autoscale_mode'] == 'warn':`
if we don't have `pg_autoscale_mode` as `on`. This causes:
the autoscaler to not throw any warnings.

Solution:
Move `if p['pg_autoscale_mode'] == 'warn':` to be
higher than `if not p['would_adjust']: continue`.

Right now, we have safety checks that will either say things are okay to stop,
return warnings, or returns ""alerts"". Warnings can be bypassed already with
the --force flag that exists for the command. However, the alerts cannot be
bypassed and cephadm will refuse to attempt to put the host in maintenance mode.
The idea here is for an additional flag that also bypasses that alerts, in cases
where a user really needs to put the host into maintenance mode even if that
means causing issues within the cluster.

Context: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/4369#issuecomment-610553571
Context: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/979562/r8-warning-missing-class-javalangclassvalue.html
Context: https://github.com/xamarin/AndroidX/issues/74

Add a minimal ProGuard configuration file to stop the following R8
warning and error:

	R8 : warning : Missing class: java.lang.ClassValue
	R8 : error : Compilation can't be completed because some library classes are missing.

This warning appears because the Guava library is cross-platform.  The
library [determines at run time whether `ClassValue` is available or
whether to fall back to a different implementation][0].  On Android,
`android.jar` does *not* include `ClassValue`, so R8 warns about it at
build time, but the warning is safe to ignore because the library will
use the fallback.  In addition, the feature that depends on `ClassValue`
is [discouraged for use on Android][1] anyway:

	# Futures.getChecked (which often won't work with Proguard anyway) uses this. It
	# has a fallback, but again, don't use Futures.getChecked on Android regardless.
	-dontwarn java.lang.ClassValue

Example scenario that currently produces the warning:

 1. Create a Xamarin.Android bindings project that references the
    Xamarin.Google.Guava NuGet package.

 2. Create a Xamarin.Android app project that references the bindings
    project.

 3. Configure the app project to use multidex and the D8 DEX compiler so
    that it will use R8 for multidex.

 4. Attempt to package the app project, for example by running:

    	msbuild -restore -p:Configuration=Release -t:PackageForAndroid

Correct typos

Change guava.jar to ReferenceJar + AndroidJavaLibrary

Partially reverts: 362ed6a0e748bdd3288614b018bd62bdd7abab56

After thinking about the scenario a bit more, I realized that the
current way the Xamarin.Google.Guava NuGet package works is atypical.
Typically, when one NuGet package depends on another NuGet package, the
consuming NuGet package does not repackage the contents of the
dependency to be part of the new NuGet package.  Instead, the final
consuming application is expected to reference both NuGet packages,
either directly or transitively.

With the current approach, where the Xamarin.Google.Guava NuGet package
uses the `@(EmbeddedReferenceJar)` item type, the final consuming
application does *not* need to reference the Xamarin.Google.Guava NuGet
package at all (even transitively).  This breaks the usual conventions
for how NuGet packages behave.  That might cause some confusion for
bindings library authors.  It also makes it awkward to provide the
correct ProGuard configuration file to the final application
automatically.

Instead of including `guava.jar` as a `@(EmbeddedReferenceJar)`, revert
back to including it as a `@(ReferenceJar)`, but this time, *also*
include `guava.jar` as an `@(AndroidJavaLibrary)`.

When a bindings project references the NuGet package, the
`@(ReferenceJar)` item type will tell the build process to reference
`guava.jar`, allowing Java libraries that depend on it to be bound.  In
this scenario, the `@(AndroidJavaLibrary)` item type will be ignored.

When an application project references the NuGet package, the
`@(AndroidJavaLibrary)` item type will instead tell the build process to
package `guava.jar` as part of the application.  In this scenario, the
`@(ReferenceJar)` item type will be ignored.

Other changes:

Replace the `@(ProguardConfiguration)` item with a target that sets up
the configuration file by appending an argument to
`$(AndroidR8ExtraArguments)` instead.  This is required for now because
when R8 is configured for multidex only with no code shrinking, the
`@(ProguardConfiguration)` items are not used.

This adds a parameter to the `_get_user_id()` method which allows for
selectively disabling the search for the user that said method performs.
This allows for code to perform it's own user search prior to calling
methods which use this method (e.g. `assign_issue`). This fixes an issue
where the search would return the wrong user due to the ordering of
users, and prevents the code from issuing duplicate search calls to the
Jira server when the user has already done so.

doing this unconditionally broke a use case when one was able to have

Context: https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinComponents/pull/830
Partially reverts: 362ed6a0e748bdd3288614b018bd62bdd7abab56
Context: https://github.com/xamarin/AndroidX/issues/74
Context: https://github.com/xamarin/GooglePlayServicesComponents/issues/308

While considering the best way to add a ProGuard configuration file to
the Xamarin.Google.Guava NuGet package, I realized that the NuGet
package was set up unusually.

Normally, when one NuGet package depends on another NuGet package, the
consuming NuGet package does not repackage the contents of the
dependency.  Instead, the final consuming application is expected to
reference both NuGet packages, either directly or transitively.

For the last couple of versions, the Xamarin.Google.Guava NuGet package
has been breaking this convention.  Those recent versions include a
`.targets` file that sets `guava.jar` to be an `@(EmbeddedReferenceJar)`
in any bindings library that references Xamarin.Google.Guava.  This
means that `guava.jar` is repackaged into the output assembly of the
bindings library.  As a result, any downstream app that consumes the
bindings library does not need to follow the normal convention of
referencing the Xamarin.Google.Guava NuGet package.  This seems likely
to cause confusion, and it also makes it awkward to include a ProGuard
configuration file in the NuGet package.

To resolve this, revert back to the approach from commit 14a3ada3 where
the `.targets` file was setting `guava.jar` to be a `@(ReferenceJar)`
instead of an `@(EmbeddedReferenceJar), but this time, also include
`guava.jar` as an `@(AndroidJavaLibrary)` for application projects.

When a bindings project references the NuGet package, the
`@(ReferenceJar)` item type tells the build process to reference
`guava.jar` but not repackage it into the output assembly.

When an application project references the NuGet package, the
`@(AndroidJavaLibrary)` item type tells the build process to package
`guava.jar` as part of the application.

I locally verified that the new `.targets` file worked correctly for
both of these scenarios.

The problem with the original approach in commit 14a3ada3 was that it
only included the `guava.jar` file as a `@(ReferenceJar)` item.  That
worked for bindings projects, but it didn't work for application
projects because application projects ignore the `@(ReferenceJar)` item
type.  One place this problem surfaced was in app builds using R8, as
seen in xamarin/AndroidX#74:

	R8 : warning : Missing class: com.google.common.util.concurrent.FutureCallback
	R8 : error : Compilation can't be completed because some library classes are missing.

Another place the problem surfaced was in running apps, as seen in
xamarin/GooglePlayServicesComponents#308:

	Java.Lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of: Lcom/google/common/base/Preconditions;

Admittedly, the only NuGet package maintained by the Xamarin team that
still references Xamarin.Google.Guava in the latest published version is
Xamarin.Firebase.Firestore, so there probably aren't too many apps that
need `guava.jar`, but it still seems like it would be nice to fix the
unconventional behavior so that Xamarin.Google.Guava can provide a
ProGuard configuration file for those apps.

Note that Xamarin.AndroidX.Room.Guava version 2.0.0 also referenced
Xamarin.Google.Guava, but the latest vesrion 2.2.5 does not because
androidx.room:room-guava [has switched][0] from Guava to the smaller
androix.concurrent:concurrent-futures library.  A likely motivation
behind that change is that the full Guava library is fairly large.

make public listIndex() and listIndexLengths() method

because used in inc/infoutils.php file

remove compatibility idx_ functions that are not used anywhere

remove compatibility ft_ functions that are not used anywhere

updateTuple() 2nd parameter

updateTuple() accept int for the second argument

Revert ""updateTuple() 2nd parameter""

This reverts commit 115f49194ce52c68de5b52a13f9f6e017b138e12.

define constants inside namespace

create QueryParser class

provides convert($query), recert_simple(), and termParser().
No needs to pass $Indexer in method's arguments.

move Quicksearch methods into MetaSearch class

pageLookup() does not use fulltext index, but metadata index

bug fix and PHP74 warnings

Warning: Parameter 1 to dokuwiki\Search\MetaSearch::callback_pageLookup() expected to be a reference, value given in /path/to/dokuwiki/inc/Extension/Event.php on line 135

change class name to MetadataSearch

Abstraction Index classes

PageIndex, PagewordIndex, MetadataIndex inherit the AbstractIndex class

separate methods into metadata, Pageword, Page index classes

make $pidCache static, refactor getPID()

all extending acstract classes should use a static pidCache array

child class of AbstractIndex must have claer()

set $errors when index lock() failed

separate deletePageNoLock() process

obsolete deletePageNoLock()

allow public access to getIndex(), etc.

define histogram() in PageIndex class

Undefined methods dispatcher

prepared for unit tests compatibility only

fix Undefined methods dispatcher

fix $errors static

remove getInstance() from AbstractIndex

rewrite deprecated idx_* functions

rewrite deprecated ft_* functions

remove global FT_SNIPPET_NUMBER

it is defined as namespace constant in Search/FulltextSearch.php file, and used in Remote/ApiCore.php and Ui/Search.php files.

use ::class for class name resolution

cast int for addIndexKey()

Does it solve scrutinizer inspection?
The expression ``$this->addIndexKey('page', '', $page);`` of type ``false|integer|string`` adds the type ``string`` to the return on line 73 which is incompatible with the return type documented by ``dokuwiki\Search\AbstractIndex::getPID`` of type ``integer|false``.

remove Undefined method dispacher for _test

separate Tokenizer class

restore accessibility protected for getIndexWords()

define getPages() in AbstractIndex instead of PageIndex

getPages() is inherited to each subclass of AbstractIndex, but MetadataIndex::getPages() will override the inherited method.

claer() idx files only created by index class

refactor getPID()

getPID() : mark deleted page entry  in page.idx
getPIDNoLock() : obsoleted
getPages() : exclude deleted pages

dispatch indexing request to addPage() or deletePage()

use Indexer.php instead of PageIndex.php

fix first argument of dbg_deprecated()

change wordlen() to non-static method

fix typo

Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master' into Refactor_Fulltext

histogram() change args order

INdexer::histogram() is only used in indexer_histogram.test.php file.

trigger error when lock/unlock index directory failed

rename PagewordIndex to FulltextIndex

obsolete fulltext.php and indexer.php files

define deprecated functions in deprecated.php file.
fix load.php,  loading fulltext.php and indexer.php is nolonger necessary.

AbstractIndex class const INDEX_MARK_DELETED

move backlinks() and mediause() into MediaIndex class

fix set Stopwords property

fix getPID()

getPID() will be called only when the page exists.

change static methods into instance methods

remove unnecessary comment

simplify dispatch()

idx_get_indexer() returns MetadataIndex

According to the development manual, for [Metadata index](https://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:metadata#metadata_index),  indexer object supports `addMetaKeys()`, `lookupKey()`, and `getpages()`. This means that `idx_get_indexer()` should return  MetadataIndex object.

Revert ""histogram() change args order""

This reverts commit 4d04b7bbfe9c97673b0f22586d88e161aca34f70.

move histogram() into MetadataIndex class

replace user errors with exceptions

Exceptions are better to handle than errors. What I don't like is that
we now have an unfortunate mix of return code and exception signalling
for errors. Some methods still return false for errors while others
now throw exceptions (always returning true otherwise).

throw IndexWriteException in saveIndex()/saveIndexkey()

remove unnecessary if blocks

getPID(), saveIndex(), saveIndexKey(), getPageWords() return always true, otherwise exceptions.

avoid null in addMetaKeys()

Just ignore $value argument if $key argument is array .
Ignore enpty key of $key argument.
Ensure to treat any null value of $key array as empty string.

change Index objects to non-singleton

Indexer, FulltextIndex, MetadataIndex uses common directory to store *.idx files, but this does not mean they should be singleton objects to avoid lock confrictions.

instantiate *Index with numeric page id

will reduce access to static $pidCache

fix scrutinizer claims

change Tokenizer static utility

frequently used in ajax call, singleton is not effective to reduce multiple instantiations.

change MetadataSearch and FulltextSearch to non-singleton

singleton is not effective to reduce multiple instantiations, especially for MetadataSearch which is frequently used in ajax call.

Updated build tools

Added TypeScript support

Added Jest support

TypeScript rewrite

Removed unused app helpers

Removed CSS namespacing option

Another option would have been to make every class name fully
configurable (the whole class name instead of just the prefix), but the
cost of it would outweigh the gain.
Also, the `stylePrefix` option wasn't even documented, so we're betting
on the fact that very few people are actually using it, if any.

Vocabulary: using ""purpose"" instead of ""app""

This change is to better align with CNIL's recommendations.
For now, the change has been made kind of brutally, so some things don't
make sense (i.e. purposes can have purposes...).
Further changes will fix the remaining problems.

Vocabulary: using ""banner"" instead of ""notice""

This seems to be the most broadly used naming.

Added missing translations keys

For now, they are just set to empty strings, but this allows to see
what's missing at a glance.

Using a raw object to provide translations

The previous mechanics were overly complicated for such a small app, and
pretty unlegible.

Improved translations naming

Allowing only one instance

Improved control over orejime and app elements

They now have more explicit names and the same possible inputs.

Made UI options more explicit

`noBanner` was removed because of its redundancy and lack of
documentation.

Removed global defaults

They were easy ways to get a config wrong in regard to GDPR
recommendations.
Forcing to set them on each purpose favors a conscious choice.

Hard coded Orejime's homepage URL

Improved handling of custom logos

Improved naming of purpose properties

Removed categories in favor of a purpose tree

Refactored dialogs

Using clearer component names

Refactored components using context and hooks

Moved most logic into the main component

Grouped cookie configuration variables

Using a clearer variable name for the privacy policy URL

Removed purpose callback

One can already get notified through the consent manager.
This avoids spreading functionality in multiple places.

Using more sensible defaults for cookie options

These come from CNIL's recommendations
https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/recommandation-cookies-et-autres-traceurs.pdf

Extracted core functionality

The core module is a refactoring of the current consent-manager, with
types and tests, and more aligned with up-to-date GDPR and CNIL
recommandations.

Using ES private identifiers

This avoids exposing internal data and allows for better mangling of
private identifiers.

Using the new core

Moved language switching into user space

This avoids loading translations for all languages at once, paving the
way for lazy loading only the required translations.
Also, there is now a unique entry point to set each translation, whereas
before some could be set either in purposes or in translations.

Lazy loading translations

This avoids packaging translations for all languages into the main
bundle.

Improved config validation

Reorganized files

Everything is now filed under dedicated folders inside `src`

Not exporting the react app anymore

Exporting config and manager at the top level

Split core and ui

The UI is now loaded only when needed.
In most cases, only the core will be loaded, thus reducing bandwidth
usage.

Added group consent

Extracted theme components

This paves the way for a theming system, by splitting components between
pure templating and pure logic/layout.

Lazy loading themes

Added DSFR theme

Optimized bundling of react-modal

Refactored trigger buttons on the demo page

Added a demo page for the DSFR theme

Added a way to preload the UI

This might come in handy to improve the UX.
For example, one could preload the UI when the user is about to click a
button to open the modal.

Updated demo configs

They are now clearer and more focused.

Filled missing translations

Refactored default styles

* Less opinionated design
* Using variables to allow for easier customization
* Using CSS to format purpose attributes (previously parenthesis
hard-coded into translations)

Fixed formatting of npm files

package.json and package-lock.json should use two spaces instead of
tabs, to be consistent with npm.

Formatted example page assets

Using latest brand color for the demo site

Improved CSS reset for default styles

Added a migration interface

This pages allow one to migrate a config from v2 to v3 to ease the
transition.

Added keywords for npm

Particularly, ""Content Management Platform"" was missing, despite being
the common name for such an app.

Fixed incorrect typings for uneval.js

Typings provided by the module were breaking the build because of type
errors.
We're using a much simpler version that just covers our use case, while
being typesafe.

Improved typings of the bootstrapping process

Dynamic imports were not typed correctly, so there were no type checks
on imported code usage.

Fixed UI loading

When loading, the modal would always be showned, regardless of the
configuration.
Now the UI is properly loaded, showing components only when needed.
It is still possible to open the modal directly with `prompt()`
(previously `show()`), as it was originally intended.

Fixed warning message about updated purposes

When the modal is forced open on startup, this message should only be
shown if the purposes were updated since the last visit.

Demo site rebranding

Using Empreinte Digitale's new visual identity.

mon/OSDMointor: Simplify check_pg_num()

* See: https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/47062.
  Originally check_pg_num did not take into account the root
  osds by the crash rule.
  This behavior resulted in an inaccurate pg num per osd count.

* Avoid summing all of the projecetd pg num and only later
  on subtracting the pg num if the pool did exist.

* With this change, we only count the projected pg num which
  are part the pools affected by the crush rule.
  Same for osd number, instead of dividing the projected
  pg number by all of the osdmap osds, divide only by
  the osds used by the crush rule.

* Avoid differentiating between whether the mapping epoch
  is later than the osdmap epoch or not. Always check the pg
  num according to crush rule.

In case of a login redirect the squash overlay prevents the user to
insert the credentials. It is also not possible to click the overlay
away, since it is only possible to do so, when setting the player state
to PLAYING. Thus the workaround with temporarily setting pressToPlay to
true works for this scenario. In order for the controls to be rendered
the pressToPlay state has to be set to false afterwards.

microcosm patch 0002

Header should contain the name of the microcosm.

Create the edit handler, but it doesn't do anything yet.  Guests may not edit.

microcosm patch 0003

Microcosm descriptions are not allowed to be nil/empty.

0134

0167

Add location to microcosms.

0057

microcosm patch 0005

0167

Order microcosms by longitude.

0155

0127

0116

0124

0118

0113

0235

Display if the changeset has review_requested.

0185

Make microcosm index look better.  Move edit link from index to show.

0178

Modify UI for mobile.

0181

Format these coords better.

0229

Replace hardcoded image of map with a leaflet map.

Remove inline javascript to comply with CSP.  Move that logic to microcosms.js.

There's no longer a need for leaflet-rails, so remove that.

0156

Rubocop said replace content_tag with tag.

In fact there's no need for either in some cases.

0194

Use tag (in place of content_tag) correctly.

0202

Factor out showMap code which will be used on multiple pages.

0180

0235

While a microcosm will eventually have multiple organizers, we need at least one person
to be responsible if an issue is raised.

Create microcosm links.

Add validation and model test for microcosm_link.

Add validate_url ruby gem to validate the urls.

Add not null on link site and url.

Add relevant FK.

0057

Organizers can create and edit their own microcosms.

(Based on feedback from Paul Norman this will later change so anyone can create microcosms.)

Add tests for controller when failures happen.

0211

Use format ""[the thing] could not be [action past tense]."".

Subject: [PATCH 208/280] Improve error messages for microcosm controller and
 test.  Use I18n, not hard coded strings. Use :alert for failure.

0208

0166

0247

0167

allow anyone to create a microcosm.  For now?

0150

0151

Use declarative spec for who can edit microcosms.

I prefer @title so templates don't need to call functions like t().

0169

Make the forms look like the rest of the website.

0174

Adapt to rubocop.  In tests factor out some WET code into helper methods.

0227

Normalize longitude input before using it.

0237

Move normalize_longitude from controller to a shared function in lib/osm.rb.  Use it at the model level.

Use translation for helper text in forms.

Factor out formMapInput.

In an earlier sequence of commits, this was factored out of the events form.

0182

Rubocop said replace content_tag with tag.

In fact there's no need for either in some cases.

0194

Use tag (in place of content_tag) correctly.

0202

0203

Remove comment about bounding box.

behavior based test

Sort by longitude and time of day

0186

Move the sorting logic for microcosms to a separate function, fix it, and document it.

Allow users to report a microcosm.

0238, 0257, 0258

Show the microcosms a user is an organizer of.

Factor our the microcosm list to be re-used in places.

0260

Use the same design pattern as in diary entries for secondary-actions.

Add CRUD and testing for MicrocosmLinks.

Links must be https.

Use bootstrap styles for the list of links.

Resolve erblint and brakeman findings.

prefer string interpolation

Use format ""[the thing] could not be [action past tense]."".

Use nested resources.

Instead of new ""All Links"" link, just use the label.

Get these tests passing once again now that we're using nested resource routes.

Rename Community to CommunityIndex.

Rename Microcosms to Communities.

Add CommunityMember.

0006

Add comment about counter_cache for performance.

0007

0039

Order of members needs to be deterministic for automated testing.

Organizers should come before members.

0157

Users may join microcosms multiple times, but only once per role.

0008

Put members on cards

0019

0048

Add diary entries of members of the microcosm

0026

Hide Join button if already a member.

0121

It's ok to have a user as both a member and an organizer.

Let only non-members join and show only pure members in Members list.

0164

Use non-ajax for joining a microcosm.

0165

0140

Replace custom styles with bootstrappy .card style.

0091 (this time with partial not user_helper)

0093

Make display_names on user_cards overflow.

0184

Only list microcosms with at least 2 members.

0239

0018

0020

0030

0049

0174

Always show the communities you belong to.

Parameterize the ""critical_mass"" (number of members needed before the community is displayed).

0260

Adapt tests for recent feature of showing only communities with more than 2 members.

If the user is not signed in, provide a link to login before having them join.

0230

0247

0231

Organizers can edit their communities.  Admin can promote members to organizers (first admin).

Allow non-admins to create a community and become the organizer of it.

Rename community.organizer to community.leader.  There is just one leader.  The leader also is a community_member with the role of organizer.  This should have been a separate commit.  Sorry.

Change access control so any organizer can modify communities, links, and members.

Allow organizers to change the role of a member.

I pulled in lots of later patches to get 100% coverage of passing tests.

0014, 0046, 0118, 0158, 0204, 0206

Use ""could not be"" phrasing.

0178

0238

Not all members are organizers

0023

0172

0166

0167

Write up a test for update microcosm as a non-organizer.

Factor out ability condition.

0215

0053

0222

Allow a member to step up and become an organizer.

Add tests for stepping up

0161, 0173

Add ability to remove memberships.

0160, 0163
0207 test delete when works
0211 test delete when fails

Now that :error is a normal flash type, we can use the shorthand version.

Also, since the error message will give addition optional reasons, we use a regex match to assert the error message.

0226

Allow user to leave a microcosm.

0224, 0225

Ignore the PermitAttributes for the assignment to community_membership.role.

Here are the changes I've made:
- Added `RGWEnv::get_optional` with the similar implementation to the `RGWHTTPArgs::get_optional`
- Replaced `RGWEnv::get` in the RGW code where null pointer derefence happens with `RGWEnv::get_optional` as long as it accepts `std::string`
- Otherwise if calling function of `RGWEnv::get` accepts `char*` I leave it as it is
- Added null pointer checks to avoid the null pointer dereference

This commit addresses the following Coverity CIDs:
- ""1510310""

microcosm patch 0002

Header should contain the name of the microcosm.

Create the edit handler, but it doesn't do anything yet.  Guests may not edit.

microcosm patch 0003

Microcosm descriptions are not allowed to be nil/empty.

0134

0167

Add location to microcosms.

0057

microcosm patch 0005

0167

Order microcosms by longitude.

0155

0127

0116

0124

0118

0113

0235

Display if the changeset has review_requested.

0185

Make microcosm index look better.  Move edit link from index to show.

0178

Modify UI for mobile.

0181

Format these coords better.

0229

Replace hardcoded image of map with a leaflet map.

Remove inline javascript to comply with CSP.  Move that logic to microcosms.js.

There's no longer a need for leaflet-rails, so remove that.

0156

Rubocop said replace content_tag with tag.

In fact there's no need for either in some cases.

0194

Use tag (in place of content_tag) correctly.

0202

Factor out showMap code which will be used on multiple pages.

0180

0235

While a microcosm will eventually have multiple organizers, we need at least one person
to be responsible if an issue is raised.

Create microcosm links.

Add validation and model test for microcosm_link.

Add validate_url ruby gem to validate the urls.

Add not null on link site and url.

Add relevant FK.

0057

Organizers can create and edit their own microcosms.

(Based on feedback from Paul Norman this will later change so anyone can create microcosms.)

Add tests for controller when failures happen.

0211

Use format ""[the thing] could not be [action past tense]."".

Subject: [PATCH 208/280] Improve error messages for microcosm controller and
 test.  Use I18n, not hard coded strings. Use :alert for failure.

0208

0166

0247

0167

allow anyone to create a microcosm.  For now?

0150

0151

Use declarative spec for who can edit microcosms.

I prefer @title so templates don't need to call functions like t().

0169

Make the forms look like the rest of the website.

0174

Adapt to rubocop.  In tests factor out some WET code into helper methods.

0227

Normalize longitude input before using it.

0237

Move normalize_longitude from controller to a shared function in lib/osm.rb.  Use it at the model level.

Use translation for helper text in forms.

Factor out formMapInput.

In an earlier sequence of commits, this was factored out of the events form.

0182

Rubocop said replace content_tag with tag.

In fact there's no need for either in some cases.

0194

Use tag (in place of content_tag) correctly.

0202

0203

Remove comment about bounding box.

behavior based test

Sort by longitude and time of day

0186

Move the sorting logic for microcosms to a separate function, fix it, and document it.

Allow users to report a microcosm.

0238, 0257, 0258

Show the microcosms a user is an organizer of.

Factor our the microcosm list to be re-used in places.

0260

Use the same design pattern as in diary entries for secondary-actions.

Add CRUD and testing for MicrocosmLinks.

Links must be https.

Use bootstrap styles for the list of links.

Resolve erblint and brakeman findings.

prefer string interpolation

Use format ""[the thing] could not be [action past tense]."".

Use nested resources.

Instead of new ""All Links"" link, just use the label.

Get these tests passing once again now that we're using nested resource routes.

Rename Community to CommunityIndex.

Rename Microcosms to Communities.

Add CommunityMember.

0006

Add comment about counter_cache for performance.

0007

0039

Order of members needs to be deterministic for automated testing.

Organizers should come before members.

0157

Users may join microcosms multiple times, but only once per role.

0008

Put members on cards

0019

0048

Add diary entries of members of the microcosm

0026

Hide Join button if already a member.

0121

It's ok to have a user as both a member and an organizer.

Let only non-members join and show only pure members in Members list.

0164

Use non-ajax for joining a microcosm.

0165

0140

Replace custom styles with bootstrappy .card style.

0091 (this time with partial not user_helper)

0093

Make display_names on user_cards overflow.

0184

Only list microcosms with at least 2 members.

0239

0018

0020

0174

Always show the communities you belong to.

Parameterize the ""critical_mass"" (number of members needed before the community is displayed).

0260

Adapt tests for recent feature of showing only communities with more than 2 members.

If the user is not signed in, provide a link to login before having them join.

0230

0247

0231

Organizers can edit their communities.  Admin can promote members to organizers (first admin).

Allow non-admins to create a community and become the organizer of it.

Rename community.organizer to community.leader.  There is just one leader.  The leader also is a community_member with the role of organizer.  This should have been a separate commit.  Sorry.

Change access control so any organizer can modify communities, links, and members.

Allow organizers to change the role of a member.

I pulled in lots of later patches to get 100% coverage of passing tests.

0014, 0046, 0118, 0158, 0204, 0206

Use ""could not be"" phrasing.

0178

0238

Not all members are organizers

0023

Add tests for stepping up

0161, 0173

Add ability to remove memberships.

0160, 0163
0207 test delete when works
0211 test delete when fails

Now that :error is a normal flash type, we can use the shorthand version.

Also, since the error message will give addition optional reasons, we use a regex match to assert the error message.

0226

Allow user to leave a microcosm.

0224, 0225

Ignore the PermitAttributes for the assignment to community_membership.role.

Add events including tests.

0015, 0195, 0196, 0197, 0199, 0201, 0211

0128

Add test for events in the past.

Adjust secondary-actions to match design pattern.

0195

0197

Make events index page look better.  Show only future events.

0179

Make event list look better.

Move edit link from show to index.  Factor out showMap code which is also used
by the microcosm show page (this was because there was a bug with showing the
map on the event page).

0180

Replace content_tag with tag.

In the ""take one"" rubocop reported this.  In ""take two"" rubocop does not
complain.  I agree with rubocop.

0202

Factor out formMapInput from event/new form and let community/new also use it.

0182

0203

Make sure events are ordered.  Separate past and future events.

0183

Add more tests for access control as non-organizer.

0213, 0125

Get tests working by not using :controller/:action in tests.

0247

Warn if event was created in or updated to the past.

The main point of this PR points towards being able to integrate Cockpit more easily with an existing infrastructure by.
Specifically:
- Be able to place the code outside public folder.
- Place the entry point (index.php) outside of the project folder.

This has been achieved by creating `\Cockpit\App` which is responsible to boot and run the cockpit application in a more encapsulated way.

`\Cockpit\App` requires has a more explicit contract and runs away of the ""extensiveness"" `bootstrap.php` allowed which makes customisation difficult (for example setting paths required both setting constants + configuration) and not very predictable.

Basically `\Cockpit\App` contains the logic of `bootstrap.php` (a little modified to simplify some points), but it also contains logic that was present in `index.php` and `cp.php` that I think belongs to this new domain.

This even allows to use cockpit from `vendor` folder when installed with composer.

Deprecation
- bootstrap.php file has been removed.
- COCKPIT_* constants are delegated to be only defined by Cockpit itself. Allowing final application to define them makes everything more difficult.
- Cockpit is no longer responsible to read the config.php/config.yml files.
   The configuration array is just injected in the App constructor. This gives freedom to use whatever method user wants to use to define their configuration.

Other changes:
- Registered PSR-0 folders in composer.json.
- Document some COCKPIT_* constants.
- Simplify some of the initialisation variables (use more meaningful names, avoid creation of temporal variables).

Adjusting getProgress()

In getProgress a current segment is ended.  I removed an uneccessary if statement below this that made a segment from the current time to the current time.  getProgress is also called in html5.js and youtube.js before determining if getArgsXAPICopmleted should be called.  getArgsXAPICompleted was also calling getProgess which results in another segment of current time to current time which is meaningless so I made progress an input to getArgsXAPICompleted so this call is only made once and the segment is ended without a meaningless one being added to the segment string.

Fix for played segments

could have garbage data with lots of timeline scrubbing, or miss some segments if user played/paused in less than 1 second intervals.

Lowered threshold of time for endPlayedSegment

This was only pushing segments if the time was greater than 1 second.  The reason being is this would get called multiple times when a user scrubbed the play bar for a seeked event, and we used the time to determine state.  We lowered this to 1/2 a second and the results seem to go well.  Seek isn’t fired multiple times when scrubbing and play and paused are recorded acurately even with short intervals.

Revert to previous version to accomodate pull

Had made changes and committed before my git tool recognized changes had already been pushed.  I’m changing to match pushed changes since they incorporate the work I was going to do anyways.

Trigger completed statement at 95% or more watched

When video ends, if the watched segments cover at least 95% of the total video time, then fire the xAPI completed statement. This covers edge cases where small imprecisions in play/pause timecodes cause getProgress() to report less-than-100% completion, even if the entire video was watched.

HFP-1779 Move videoXAPI variable to video.js

HFP-1779 Prevent triggering paused before seeked
The current implementation of H5P.Video was not designed to track
the experience of the user or video state as perceived by the user.
This job is left to the content type using H5P.Video, which forces the
implementation of new xAPI verbs to be quirky. Also, it might not be
possible to get rid of some unneccesary xAPI statements that are
fired unless there's some refactoring which would also include e.g.
Interactive Video.

Updating the currently playing segment start time when the video starts playing is required in certain scenarios. For example, If a user revisits a page with a youtube video that they had previously partially watched, the video will resume from where they left off. If we don’t set `playingSegmentStart` on the play event, the first playing segment recorded will start at 0 (the beginning of the video) rather than the timecode the video resumed from.

Changes apt-key usages to saving a local keyring directly via gpg. No new dependencies are introduced. Updates all apt source list configurations (Ubuntu, Debian and Raspbian) to use the signed-by feature pointing to this local keyring.

Usage of apt-key will be deprecated as per the manual apt-key(8): ""apt-key will last be available in Debian 11 and Ubuntu 22.04.""

Usage of global trusted PGP keys is also deprecated as they are widely insecure: they are unconditionally trusted by APT on all other repositories configured on the system that don't have a signed-by option, even the official Debian / Ubuntu repositories. As a result, any unofficial APT repository which has its signing key added to /etc/apt/trusted.gpg or /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d can replace any package on the system.

According to the Debian wiki, the more proper and secure way of adding third-party repositories is to use the Signed-By feature in the apt’s sources list configuration. This should point to a local keyring, usually defined in /usr/share/keyrings/, with a trailing 'archive-keyring' postfix.

See: https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/UseThirdParty
See: https://michael-prokop.at/blog/2021/02/16/how-to-properly-use-3rd-party-debian-repository-signing-keys-with-apt/

Ensures .gnupg directory exists for root

gnupg is quite finnicky when retrieving keys from a keyserver to a standalone keyring. 

A .gnupg directory *must* exist (preferably with correct permission) for the invoking user to temporarily store a keyring.

Since keys used for apt distribution are recommended to be stored in a root-accessible only directory, gpg is invoked by the root user, and /root/.gnupg must be created (as it typically does not exist). This is entirely harmless but necessary to avoid gpg erroring on inexistant directory.

Remove apt-transport-https on already supported versions

Https transport should already be required in apt in Debian 9+ or Ubuntu 18.04+.

... for downloadable code blocks.

This is more a feature request than it is a pull request, but I've done it like this to easily show/allow others to modify the code. Underneath my changes, at line 34, I've put in a commented out alternative version, primarily to demonstrate an alternative approach.

I've been using Dokuwiki for a while to create and provide scripts for novice users to download and use for a small custom distribution based on Linux we are building that is typically deployed and edited on a remote network connection, using another computer to make those edits. This all works wonderfully well when downloading the files in a strictly Linux environment, however I've found out that users of Windows computers (which I've found out, is most of my reader's primary OS) were receiving these files with the incorrect CRLF line terminators. Looking through the web I found https://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki/issues/863 , a change made around six years ago making DokuWiki automatically detect and change the line feed used in the downloaded file depending on the user's operating system. The actual commit merged that fixed it is https://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki/pull/872 .

This is a neat feature, and I wouldn't want to undo that behaviour by default, but I would like to add a flag that editors can use to specify ""hey, this is a Unix script, and the linefeeds need to remain untouched"", so that neophyte users can simply download and use the script files as they are without having to do additional line feed conversions.

I'm aware that I'm changing the number of arguments that this function accepts, and that this would cause issues elsewhere, that's precisely why I'm asking for assistance here! I'm not a veteran DokuWiki coder, so please feel free to completely change this code, or close this pull request if it can be implemented in a much better way. The original PR I'm seeing that changed this behaviour in the first place only edited this file, so I'm not even sure where to begin looking for other files that might be calling this one, if there are any at all.

microcosm patch 0002

Header should contain the name of the microcosm.

Create the edit handler, but it doesn't do anything yet.  Guests may not edit.

microcosm patch 0003

Microcosm descriptions are not allowed to be nil/empty.

0134

0167

Add location to microcosms.

0057

microcosm patch 0005

0167

Order microcosms by longitude.

0155

0127

0116

0124

0118

0113

0235

Display if the changeset has review_requested.

0185

Make microcosm index look better.  Move edit link from index to show.

0178

Modify UI for mobile.

0181

Format these coords better.

0229

Replace hardcoded image of map with a leaflet map.

Remove inline javascript to comply with CSP.  Move that logic to microcosms.js.

There's no longer a need for leaflet-rails, so remove that.

0156

Rubocop said replace content_tag with tag.

In fact there's no need for either in some cases.

0194

Use tag (in place of content_tag) correctly.

0202

Factor out showMap code which will be used on multiple pages.

0180

0235

While a microcosm will eventually have multiple organizers, we need at least one person
to be responsible if an issue is raised.

Create microcosm links.

Add validation and model test for microcosm_link.

Add validate_url ruby gem to validate the urls.

Add not null on link site and url.

Add relevant FK.

0057

Organizers can create and edit their own microcosms.

(Based on feedback from Paul Norman this will later change so anyone can create microcosms.)

Add tests for controller when failures happen.

0211

Use format ""[the thing] could not be [action past tense]."".

Subject: [PATCH 208/280] Improve error messages for microcosm controller and
 test.  Use I18n, not hard coded strings. Use :alert for failure.

0208

0166

0247

0167

allow anyone to create a microcosm.  For now?

0150

0151

Use declarative spec for who can edit microcosms.

I prefer @title so templates don't need to call functions like t().

0169

Make the forms look like the rest of the website.

0174

Adapt to rubocop.  In tests factor out some WET code into helper methods.

0227

Normalize longitude input before using it.

0237

Move normalize_longitude from controller to a shared function in lib/osm.rb.  Use it at the model level.

Use translation for helper text in forms.

Factor out formMapInput.

In an earlier sequence of commits, this was factored out of the events form.

0182

Rubocop said replace content_tag with tag.

In fact there's no need for either in some cases.

0194

Use tag (in place of content_tag) correctly.

0202

0203

Remove comment about bounding box.

behavior based test

Sort by longitude and time of day

0186

Move the sorting logic for microcosms to a separate function, fix it, and document it.

Allow users to report a microcosm.

0238, 0257, 0258

Show the microcosms a user is an organizer of.

Factor our the microcosm list to be re-used in places.

0260

Use the same design pattern as in diary entries for secondary-actions.

Add CRUD and testing for MicrocosmLinks.

Links must be https.

Use bootstrap styles for the list of links.

Resolve erblint and brakeman findings.

prefer string interpolation

Use format ""[the thing] could not be [action past tense]."".

Use nested resources.

Instead of new ""All Links"" link, just use the label.

Get these tests passing once again now that we're using nested resource routes.

Rename Community to CommunityIndex.

Rename Microcosms to Communities.

Add CommunityMember.

0006

Add comment about counter_cache for performance.

0007

0039

Order of members needs to be deterministic for automated testing.

Organizers should come before members.

0157

Users may join microcosms multiple times, but only once per role.

0008

Put members on cards

0019

0048

Add diary entries of members of the microcosm

0026

Hide Join button if already a member.

0121

It's ok to have a user as both a member and an organizer.

Let only non-members join and show only pure members in Members list.

0164

Use non-ajax for joining a microcosm.

0165

0140

Replace custom styles with bootstrappy .card style.

0091 (this time with partial not user_helper)

0093

Make display_names on user_cards overflow.

0184

Only list microcosms with at least 2 members.

0239

0018

0020

0030

0049

0174

Always show the communities you belong to.

Parameterize the ""critical_mass"" (number of members needed before the community is displayed).

0260

Adapt tests for recent feature of showing only communities with more than 2 members.

If the user is not signed in, provide a link to login before having them join.

0230

0247

0231

Organizers can edit their communities.  Admin can promote members to organizers (first admin).

Allow non-admins to create a community and become the organizer of it.

Rename community.organizer to community.leader.  There is just one leader.  The leader also is a community_member with the role of organizer.  This should have been a separate commit.  Sorry.

Change access control so any organizer can modify communities, links, and members.

Allow organizers to change the role of a member.

I pulled in lots of later patches to get 100% coverage of passing tests.

0014, 0046, 0118, 0158, 0204, 0206

Use ""could not be"" phrasing.

0178

0238

Not all members are organizers

0023

0172

0166

0167

Write up a test for update microcosm as a non-organizer.

Factor out ability condition.

0215

0053

0222

Allow a member to step up and become an organizer.

Add tests for stepping up

0161, 0173

Add ability to remove memberships.

0160, 0163
0207 test delete when works
0211 test delete when fails

Now that :error is a normal flash type, we can use the shorthand version.

Also, since the error message will give addition optional reasons, we use a regex match to assert the error message.

0226

Allow user to leave a microcosm.

0224, 0225

Ignore the PermitAttributes for the assignment to community_membership.role.

Add events including tests.

0015, 0195, 0196, 0197, 0199, 0201, 0211

Create route for community events.  Use events#index and apply a filter for
the community.

0020

0024

0025

Add sample map of location for event.

0027

Add sample directions

0028

Remove styles.  Will add style after it is functional.

0048

Remove disabled code

0049

Translate all the things.

0055

0090

0115, 0120, 0123

Create validation and model test for events.  Improve factory.

0128

Add test for events in the past.

Adjust secondary-actions to match design pattern.

0195

0197

Make events index page look better.  Show only future events.

0179

Make event list look better.

Move edit link from show to index.  Factor out showMap code which is also used
by the microcosm show page (this was because there was a bug with showing the
map on the event page).

0180

Replace content_tag with tag.

In the ""take one"" rubocop reported this.  In ""take two"" rubocop does not
complain.  I agree with rubocop.

0202

Factor out formMapInput from event/new form and let community/new also use it.

0182

0203

Make sure events are ordered.  Separate past and future events.

0183

Add more tests for access control as non-organizer.

0213, 0125

Get tests working by not using :controller/:action in tests.

0247

Warn if event was created in or updated to the past.

When using constants instead of strings, use them everywhere.

0219

Create update_params for update and add another test.

Finish writing tests for EventAttendancesController.

0220

Handle plurals better

0228

Add maybe constant and convenience functions.

Convert event attendance intention to enum.

0273

Display RSVPs as cards using a partial.

User can only update their own RSVP.

 test.  Use I18n, not hard coded strings. Use :alert for failure.

0208

0166

0247

0167

allow anyone to create a microcosm.  For now?

0150

0151

Use declarative spec for who can edit microcosms.

I prefer @title so templates don't need to call functions like t().

0169

Make the forms look like the rest of the website.

0174

Adapt to rubocop.  In tests factor out some WET code into helper methods.

0227

Normalize longitude input before using it.

0237

Move normalize_longitude from controller to a shared function in lib/osm.rb.  Use it at the model level.

Use translation for helper text in forms.

Factor out formMapInput.

In an earlier sequence of commits, this was factored out of the events form.

0182

Rubocop said replace content_tag with tag.

In fact there's no need for either in some cases.

0194

Use tag (in place of content_tag) correctly.

0202

0203

Remove comment about bounding box.

behavior based test

Sort by longitude and time of day

0186

Move the sorting logic for microcosms to a separate function, fix it, and document it.

Allow users to report a microcosm.

0238, 0257, 0258

Show the microcosms a user is an organizer of.

Factor our the microcosm list to be re-used in places.

0260

Use the same design pattern as in diary entries for secondary-actions.

Add CRUD and testing for MicrocosmLinks.

Links must be https.

Use bootstrap styles for the list of links.

Resolve erblint and brakeman findings.

prefer string interpolation

Use format ""[the thing] could not be [action past tense]."".

Use nested resources.

Instead of new ""All Links"" link, just use the label.

Get these tests passing once again now that we're using nested resource routes.

Rename Community to CommunityIndex.

Rename Microcosms to Communities.

MemoryIndexes only need to be saved back when they have been modified

Add a first collection based on the old FullText Index

This collection is meant as a base class for fulltext indexes, a page
specific implementation will follow.

Currently contains lots of dead code that needs to be removed or
replaced.

Fix autoloading for tests

Namespace based loading for core tests  did not work as intended (but hasn't
been used so far)

Use base class for searchIndex tests

Many tests are the same for File and Memory indexes

added method to search an index by regular expression

WIP fulltext collection

add method to retrieve multiple rows at once

Indexes can now be opened in readonly mode

Working fulltext collection and search

This finalizes the FulltextCollection and FulltextCollectionSearch
classes. Proper locking is implemented, tests have been enhanced.

It should be possible to reimplement the page full text search on top of
it.

Standalone implementation of tool shed client...

Decompose tool shed + schema package.

This commit creates two new packages - below a description of these packages and why they are being created.

galaxy-schema: This package contains the pydantic models that power the API. The purpose of packaging them is to ensure they can be reused by clients with minimal external dependencies. Reusing the schema in client code would very quickly provide rapid documentation and validation and static checking for Python clients using the Galaxy API.

galaxy-tool-shed: This package contains the tool shed server code. This has been a long term project to allow the tool shed to be spun out but maintain real galaxy dependencies and maintain testing. More discussions around this project can be found as part of https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/8830.

metadata_generator: use TYPE_CHECKING to avoid dependency issues

metadata_generator: mark cleanup_repository_metadata as private

Fix up clean up repository metadata...

metadata_generator: Small typing fixes for tool shed metadata_generator

Move generate_clone_url_for_repository_in_tool_shed into tool shed.

Allow external shed testing.

Use repository manager to capture more of the upload process.

Remove unused repository manager code (hard to de-conflict with upload stuff).

Integration-y unit tests for the core tool shed code.

Fix API uploads to do more work that happens in web uploads.

Allows porting more of the tests to the API.

Progress toward exercising less of the tool shed upload API.

So we can kill it.

More integration-y unit tests for tool shed...

Remove upload controller - everything should come through the API now.

Remove upload_point upload logic in tool shed.

Not used by planemo and not tested by any tests.

metadata_generator: no metadata for workflows and datatypes

We dropped workflows and datatypes from shed - don't generate metadata based on them.

metadata_generator: Typing has improved to the point that we can annotate this.

Bug fix: data manager changes misaligned...

- Data manager changes force a new installable changeset on reset but not when updating repositories.

Refactor install manager a bit to isolate interaction.

Remove contact owner functionality from the tool shed - use github please.

Tool Shed API Modernization ahead of FastAPI

- Use the controller base that allow DI.
- Move a bunch functionality we want to port to FastAPI into manage layer.
- Some typing enhancements.

Modernized framework to replace tool shed functional tests.

Goals:

- Replace direct database access with pydantic typed API requests.
- Replace Twill with playwright.
- Eliminate access to the Galaxy UI in the tests - the tests should assume API access from the installing party.

pytest-playwright requires small bits of #13909.

This is a worthy project that could let us remove a bunch of deprecated stuff from the Galaxy admin controllers and a bunch of mako stuff that is unused and could be used to test PRs like #14609 (which prompted me to do this) but I'm anxious about growing emotionally attached to code I want to remove and I'm worried about losing track of which helpers are required for Planemo/Emphemeris/Galaxy and which helpers are just being used to test the tool shed.

This is a first step at stuff at restructuring the indexing classes a
bit more.

Some background:

We have basically two different kind of index files:

a) RowIndex (like page.idx)

Each line in the index contains a single value. The line number is used
as primary ID. These files can be very large. Thus an index like that
should never be read into memory completely if it can be avoided.

b) TupleIndex (like i12.idx)

Each line contains a list of tuples. The files tend to be smaller so
loading them completely for search and replace is easier.

Since the the access is so completely different, I tried to model that
in the two different classes, basically moving the methods from
\dokuwiki\Search\AbstractIndex to the new classes.

While doing so, I tried to make the doc blocks, variable names and
interface easier to understand. I also added tests for each of the
methods.

The old code has not been touched yet. So these classes do not do
anything outside of tests currently.

Add support to access multiple rows at once

When saving word indexs (w*.idx) often multiple words of the same length
will need to be accessed. This implements a new method that allows that
in an efficient way.

Note: this removes the INDEX_MARK_DELETED mechanism to mark deleted
entries. Entries are now deleted using empty lines again. This makes the
batch handling much simpler. If a good reason exists that we should keep
it, it can be readded.

Changed IndexAccessor names based on access method not content

we need the same access methods in both index types

better method names

retrieveRow needs to pad the index, too

Message retraction support in MAM for RDBMS

This PR introduces support for the XEP-0424 Message Retraction.
    Retraction messages are stored in MAM archives even though they contain no body, as required by the XEP.
    MAM archives using RDBMS handle the retraction messages by replacing the original message (referenced by origin-id) with a tombstone.

TO DO in next pull requests:
    Discovery of the retraction feature.
    Documentation of the retraction feature.
    Possible error replies to the sender when the message to retract from MAM does not exist.

change the order of advertising auth mechanisms

Merge pull request #2745 from esl/order_auth_mech

Order of advertising the auth mechanisms

As per the XMPP core RFC, the authentication mechanisms that are advertised to the client SHOULD be in order of perceived strength to enable the strongest authentication possible.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120#section-6.3.3

New order of advertising the authentication mechanisms is the following:

```
<mechanisms xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'>
	<mechanism>SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS</mechanism>
	<mechanism>SCRAM-SHA-512</mechanism>
	<mechanism>SCRAM-SHA-384-PLUS</mechanism>
	<mechanism>SCRAM-SHA-384</mechanism>
	<mechanism>SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS</mechanism>
	<mechanism>SCRAM-SHA-256</mechanism>
	<mechanism>SCRAM-SHA-224-PLUS</mechanism>
	<mechanism>SCRAM-SHA-224</mechanism>
	<mechanism>SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS</mechanism>
	<mechanism>SCRAM-SHA-1</mechanism>
	<mechanism>PLAIN</mechanism>
</mechanisms>
```

Important note on the order is that this PR is addressing the order of the default modules. Configuring the sasl_mechanisms parameter will take precedence over this list. Should more than one parameter be configured in in the list of sasl_mechanisms, the order of how they are listed in the config will be taken as the order when the mechanisms are advertised.

Having {sasl_mechanisms, [cyrsasl_scram_sha1, cyrsasl_plain, cyrsasl_scram_sha256]} will result in following order:

```
<mechanisms xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'>
    <mechanism>SCRAM-SHA-1</mechanism>
    <mechanism>PLAIN</mechanism>
    <mechanism>SCRAM-SHA-256</mechanism>
</mechanisms>
```

Configuration of the external authentication method is done though configuring the sasl_mechanisms parameter. As long as it is the cyrsasl_external is the first element in sasl_mechanisms list, it will be advertised in the first place.

Upstream functionalities of `html-webpack-plugin` aren't
duplicated anymore which dictates injection to be enabled in
contrast to previous requirements.
Template is greatly simplified by utilizing modern es6
constructs and preparing required data inside topmost ejs block.
`appMountId` defaults to `app` in case `appMountIds` haven't
been provided.
New option is added: `description` - renders as appropriate meta.
New section is added: `<noscript>` - displays friendly warning
in case javascript execution is turned off.

BREAKING CHANGE: `baseHref`, `meta`, `favicon`,
`inlineManifestWebpackName` & `devServer` options are deprecated!

This caused a subtle bug where the first exception reported would include the request context, but subsequent exceptions would not.

In addition, the AspNetCore version would never set the StatusCode or StatusDescription in the Response
since _currentHttpContext was set to null by BuildRequestMessage() just before BuildResponseMessage() was called.
Note that StatusCode would not typically be set if an exception occurred on ASP.NET Core since the Raygun HTTP
module does not exist on this platform, but custom middleware might want to do this.
For example, custom middleware might watch for certain HTTP status codes and report them.

As long as RaygunClient objects are short-lived, this should not cause any memory leaks.

Problem:
-------
At a high level, creating a primary snapshot consists of three steps:

1. actually creating a snapshot in the mirror namespace
2. generating a set of image state objects with additional metadata for
   the snapshot
3. marking the snapshot as complete after the image state objects are
   written out

Depending on the circumstances, a request to create a primary snapshot
can be forwarded to rbd-mirror daemon.  If that happens and rbd-mirror
daemon gets axed for some practical reason after completing steps (1)
and/or (2) but before completing step (3), we are left with a
permanently incomplete primary snapshot because upon retrying that
primary snapshot creation request, librbd notices that such snapshot
already exists.  It does not check whether this ""pre-existing"" snapshot
is complete.

Solution:
--------
As part of the next mirror snapshot create (say triggered by the
scheduler) the unlink_peer() is called, it checks if there exists any
incomplete snapshot and delete them accordingly.

Fixes: https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/58887
Signed-off-by: Prasanna Kumar Kalever <prasanna.kalever@redhat.com>

librbd: always refresh after creating snapshot in CreatePrimaryRequest

Up until now this was conditioned on whether the caller expressed
interest in the ID of the created snapshot and happened to work only
because CreatePrimaryRequest wasn't actually consulting any mirror
snapshot metadata.  This has just changed with unlink_peer() needing to
see an up-to-date complete flag which is set in SetImageStateRequest
following the write out of image state object(s).

Also includes some work on configuration saving.

Use the right text domain

Add $filename to replace_line_in_file() so it's more useful.

We'll use it to write to the global config file.

Add functions to check setup.

The functions will check if advanced-cache.php exists and WP_CACHE is
defined in wp-config.php

In admin page check the setup before showing settings.

The plugin will attempt to create the file advanced-cache.php  and add
WP_CACHE to wp-config.php

Remove "", so the path to the plugin is correct

Check for WPCACHEHOME and improve advanced-cache.php creation

Use a HEREDOC to create the advanced-cache.php and add functions to
check and add WPCACHEHOME to wp-config.php

Add wp_super_cache_create_cache() to process output buffer.

Rename the get_cache_dir() function so it has the right prefix.

Fill in more code from the plugin.

* Use the config class to get the configuration as we need it to write
too for debugging.
* Add a new class to add debugging.

Next TODO: create a blank configuration files to save to.

Add code to create a blank configuration file.

Add a ""$caching = 0"" to the config file.

Change caching to cache_enabled

Add a User class and move code in there.

$config is an object, not an array.

Ignore this, the plugin does lots of filesystem actions.

Add sample config file

Fix case of config class and add wp_cache_home_path setting function.

Change how the $config is used.

Instead of creating a local $config just use $this->config->config.

Lots of changes:

* Renamed caching to file-cache
* Add cache debug setting to admin page.
* Added Page class to represent the current page.
* And more ..

Use the gzip_encoding() function

Check ""cache_compression"" setting in the gzip_encoding function

Rename function ok_to_cache to is_cacheable

Check if this exists before setting it.

Add make_anonymous()

Fixed up is_caching_disabled and debugging logs

Move cache_init into Page class contructor

Minor changes, for phpcs

Fix ""cache_enabled"" check and add customizer check

Fix call to gzip_encoding()

Cache query_vars to speed it up.

Split cache checks into pre and post.

Some checks on ""cacheability"" can only be run after WordPress has loaded
so query vars are defined.

Remove wp_super_cache_config and clean up debug code.

Forgot a description for this function

phpcs fix and move post checks into output buffer handler

Oops, this is an array, not a function.

Move post check into this output buffer function

Multiple fixes.

Fix UA check, remove url check, and fix privacy status of post check
function.

Move $wp_query check to get_query_vars()

Tiny typo in 404 query var.

Added set_env function.

This function will cache various blog settings for the shutdown process
since $wpdb may have been destroyed by the time shutdown happens.

Multiple changes.

* Move query vars into config class.
* Add get_cache_meta_information() for non-anon requests.
* Add Page set_env() to replace base file to setup request info.
* Replace wp_super_cache_request_uri with WPSC_URI constant

Multiple changes:

* Add get_response_headers
* Add get_post_id
* Fire wp_set_env on 'template_redirect' so query vars are set.
* Put post_id in a config variable.

Add functions to create cache folders and call from setup.

Add page to the admin so environment is setup.

* Fix the blog cache path since only MU installs with have a ""blogs""
directory.

Move cache directory creation to file cache and call via filter.

This will allow us to use different cache storage backends in the
future.

This config variable isn't used any more.

Multiple changes:

* Move DISABLE_SUPERCACHE and WPCACHEHOME checks into page class.
* Delete wp-cache-base code as it was moved elsewhere already.
* Define $wp_super_cache_config in pre-wp-cache.php and use object
rather than config array. Fix associated code.
* Delete wpsc_is_backend - it's moved elsewhere.

Remove broken ""cache_enabled"" check and move debugging around.

Remove this, not needed now.

Tiny whitespace diff

2. The :preference_key parameter would not be URL decoded.

  logic is no longer necessary.

- We don't need to synchronize with the session becase the session is
  expired at the end of this method.

Typing for container resolvers

probably do not qualify as unit test

but at least useful for understanding

Co-authored-by: Nuwan Goonasekera <2070605+nuwang@users.noreply.github.com>

doc: more intro

doc cont:

add container conf sample

doc

doc cnt

more typing:

- made ContainerResolver.app_info required (non Optional)
  also in all other derived resolvers

  because its used non-Optional in the initialisation
  of the Container classes (where also no check for None is
  done)

- ContainerDescription.identifier required

  same reason

tests: add integration and fix unit tests

unit tests: by adding the now mandatory app_info argument

remove the new unit tests again (they are now implemented as integration
tests)

container description: make identifier non-optional

doc: cont

containers: do not mount /tmp/

fixes https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/15673

- singularity: add `--no_mount tmp` (analogous to docker's default)
- do not bind `$TMPDIR:rw,$TMP:rw,$TEMP:rw` by default
- instead (by default )provide a writable `/tmp` via
  `$_GALAXY_JOB_TMP_DIR/:/tmp:rw` note that this dir is still also
  available as `$_GALAXY_JOB_TMP_DIR:rw`

refactor volume preprocessing

to be able to cope with ""default_ro"" when the source directory
is given

remove volumes with duplicate targets

integration test runs now

due to fixes /tmp handling in containers

code: post rebase cleanup

test: post rebase cleanup

test: restructuring

doc: cnt

more tests

doc: continue

test: cont

tests: enforce container type

this is probably not excactly what is done when listing containers
in the admin UI. This is because a container type is only set via
the destination a job is executed on. That is, for listing and
building both container types are allowed, which might lead to
unwanted outcomes if the container resolver config contains resolvers
for both container types (like the default does).

restructure tests and add tests for explicit container resolvers

The current default, `w+`, overwrites the contents of the file on the first write. Since `emit` opens and writes to the file every time it's called, this effectively rewrites the file on every `emit`. Perhaps this is intended behavior, but it took me a while to understand why there was only one span written to my file, even though I could tell multiple were being emitted. I didn't have my [Python file mode tables](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) memorized, so at first glance `w+` sounded like ""write mode, + for append"", and I overlooked it while debugging.

I think `a` (append) would be a more intuitive default.

Added:
- Pagination with PaginatedList class

Also added:
- Sorting upon clicking the Category names
- Search feature
- Page Size update
- A notification message that auto hides

Task 2

Added:
- SuperPanel.API project to handle the Deletion Requests as a Background Service

How it works:
1. User deletes one or several entries from SuperPanel View
2. SuperPanel.API handles the request until deletion is successful
3. The API updates SuperPanel with SignalR -> the users sees a notification

Task 3-4

Bulk deletion was already available using the same approach:

- User can tick one or more checkboxes
- SuperPanel.API handles the request(s) in the background despite errors from ExternalContacts.Api

Note: users are deleted in the users.json file to show the updated list after each deletion is successful

To Do: implement tests and
add a UI to keep track of the pending deletions in real time

Under some circumstances it is useful to know if the current parsing
process is running in a page context or not.

One of the examples is the struct plugin's use of the PARSER_HANDLER_DONE
event to automatically inject its own output instruction. Currently this
instruction is injected in each and every processing and only on rendering
is decided if there is anything to output.

This patch injects a page hint into the Handler when the handler was
created from our p_wiki_xhtml() method (and only then). Plugins can use
the getPage() method to check the context if needed.

Note: currently p_wiki_xhtml() also modifies the global $ID variable
which might also used as context hint (but will also be set during
on-the-fly renders, eg. the preview intro text).

It would probably be a good idea to check if it would be better when all
handle methods rely on getPage() instead of global $ID instead. This
would be a major change in parsing though and needs serious testing
while this addition has basically no consequences currently.

I've added more detailed instructions on how to lookup usernames starting with hyphens, as well as added some code to remove the trailing whitespace character in front of the hypen.

The only solution to this issue, without major changes to the current code, is to tell the user to incase the target username within quotations as well as prefix a space to the target username. For example ' -username'.

The reason why this has to be done is because it's a bug within argparse itself as can be seen here: https://bugs.python.org/issue9334

The conclusion of the thread was that it's not worth fixing and therefore it still remains.

Fixed typo

This modification primarily attempts to make working with the OAuth flow
easier for an integrator. It also fixes the OAuth flow so that there's a
full round trip for both installation and app authorization.

I believe before we were never doing the full round trip for
standard authorization.

Additionally, we've added a couple of hooks that use the ShopifyAPI
module configuration pattern to allow integrators to hook into the auth
flow without needing to understand the nitty-gritty details of how it
works.

But because there is always going to be some amount of manual
configuration required for the app to be installed in the Shopify store
and that necessitates some underlying understanding of how the OAuth
flow works, we've attempted to add some documentation both in the README
as well as in the routes file to help integrators with understanding how
things work.

The modifications in the routes file break what was there before -- the
routes that were defined are no longer valid. I believe that this will
not really be a dealbreaker for most, as I believe that the former
implementation required integrators to have their own self-baked
solution in place.

This modification hopefully makes it easier to integrate the library
into an application authorization flow. It includes addition of callback
hooks dedicated to making authorization more simple and more
explicit.

A few things have changed between majopr versions of boostrap, but the
main things we had to migrate here were:

* left and right margin / padding / text alignment utilities now use the
  start and end terminology.
* data-* attributes that bootstrap 4 used to enable javascript things
  now use the data-bs-* prefix
* form-groups are no more -- we just use the padding utilities for these
  now
* finally, bootstrap 5 doens't need jquery anymore. We still have to
  include it as we use it elsewhere, but ideally we migrate that code in
the future so we arent using jquery anymore.

Initial commit of Django project setup, using a Django app for emaildrafter (so that REST apps etc can be in their own directories)

Moved emaildrafter to project root as that is more standard for Django. Replaced secret key with generated one for development environment - Important to note this branch is not production ready at all, and settings.py must be altered before deploying in any setting.

Model relations set up

Serving static files correctly, implemented homepage and about us, need to address postcode lookup (but might want to embed into Django Form)

Added some docstrings and consideration of how to fill template bodies in a django-friendly way.

Removed extraneous definition of template submission form

Removed HEAD in requirements.txt leftover from rebase

Added logic for filling and validating template bodies, plus generating slugs from template names.

Moved address lookup to an external apis file, and added constituency to user form, returned from postcode api endpoint

User input now Django Form, with JS alterations

 - Rending form automatically from Django Form
   (CSS adjustments still required)

 - Getting postcode data from /postcode/ endpoint

 - Filling address + constituency from JSON response

 - Form validating successfully

Added models to admin, tested template filling

 - Added all the relevant models to the admin UI and submitted an example template and MP

 - Succesfully filled the template with UserForm and Target data

 - Adjusted the target property of a template to correspond to either the specific target or MP

 - ToDo: Remove the blank space in the Email Body textarea widget, adjust landing page CSS, switch to PostgreSQL db and re-implement topic and single template endpoints.

""composing"" is used on Japanese (and other CJK scripts) when typing on a qwerty or similar keyboard, showing something akin to autocomplete on iOS. You confirm a word by pressing enter, which shouldn't commit to a search.
