Tracking updates by breaking them into Adds / Deletes on the frontend feels brittle because you are surfacing up what should be a backend implementation detail into the network - what happens if removeUsersFromTeam times out / fails? Or what happens if removeUsersFromTeam passes but addUserstoTeam fails? It is very easy to create some wonky team state on the backend this way. There is no way to ensure the dependence of HTTP calls without significant overhead - this is not a problem on the backend (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction).

What if you took a list of 4 emails to the backend, and the backend iterates through them, figures out if they are valid and insert the team if all input was valid?

Was it intended to have the action endpoint off the `/cna` endpoint? For me it's more appropriate to have it off the whole resource (`/cve/:cve-id`) because that's what is getting rejected. Also, due to the nature of the structure of a rejected record, the containers actually become non-existent.

I'm guessing the schema is WIP and we'll add the rejected schema once we actually build it.

There's a couple of things here that need addressing though:

* If the `flash` CSS is no longer required elsewhere, then it should be removed from `common.scss`
* Large numbers of tests are failing, since they are looking for the `flash` and `error` css classes. The tests need to be updated.

* The contents of this `div` need to be indented. The same with other places where you are wrapping existing code with additional `divs`.


Offline and read_only modes are not ""danger"" messages, since there's nothing that the user can or has done wrong. 

If we look at the `map_layout` helper in https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/blob/e443d99edd9c9b68d6c0fa41b028bb9a5cdb07c5/app/controllers/application_controller.rb#L258-L263 we can see that both are treated as `warning` messages

For both the offline and edit pages, we end up with ""alert""-style banners, but these don't match the flash banners used on the rest of the site, namely:

* They don't stretch across the whole page
* They don't have the icon alongside the message

It would be nice to make them completely consistent, rather than partially consistent. So for example, I would consider reworking this page to use the existing flash messages system to render the alert, for example by using `flash.now[:warning] = t(""layouts.osm_offline"")` in the controller. That way any changes made to flash messages elsewhere (e.g. adjusting margins or paddings) will apply automatically to these offline alert messages.

> If the `flash` CSS is no longer required elsewhere, then it should be removed from `common.scss`

There are quite a few tests which require the old classes and they were passing on the first test. Would it be OK if I update all instances of the current `flash` classes to `alert` (as well as their tests) or it would it be better to do it in a separate PR?

> Large numbers of tests are failing, since they are looking for the `flash` and `error` css classes. The tests need to be updated.

I've updated them.





Thanks for updating the tests. I'm not sure what you mean with your question for me. I think there is no longer any reason to keep the `flash` rules in `common.scss`, right? I can't see anywhere they are still in use.

I'm not exactly sure what exactly needs to be done here. Would this work or the changes need to be made somewhere else?

```
<% if Settings.status == ""database_offline"" %>
<p><%= flash.now[:warning] = t(""layouts.osm_offline"") %>
</p>
<% else %>
<p><%= flash.now[:warning] = t(""layouts.osm_read_only"") %>
</p>
<% end %>
```

You are right. I was confused since a few tests succeeded even though I didn't update them. They are now fixed.

> Would this work

Something similar to this actually does work - the trick is that you can add flash messages from a view (since it appears the view is processed before the layout) but you need to avoid also writing the message at the same time. So no `<p>` tags and no `<%=` outputs. This works:

```
<% if Settings.status == ""database_offline"" %>
  <% flash.now[:warning] = t(""layouts.osm_offline"") %>
<% else %>
  <% flash.now[:warning] = t(""layouts.osm_read_only"") %>
<% end %>
```

However, I find that a bit unintuitive, since it depends on a timing issue with rendering views vs layouts, and usually flash messages are set in the controller before rendering starts. So I would avoid using `flash.now` in any views. When I said:

> for example by using `flash.now[:warning] = t(""layouts.osm_offline"")` **in the controller**

... I was thinking about changing the `site#offline` method (in SiteController) something like this:

```diff
-  def offline; end
+  def offline
+    flash.now[:warning] = if Settings.status == ""database_offline""
+                            t(""layouts.osm_offline"")
+                          else
+                            t(""layouts.osm_read_only"")
+                          end
+  end
```
At this point, the view can be empty, and this will work. Having an empty view is a bit strange, so I would either think of something to put in there (for example, further explanation, but I'm not sure if that is useful) or else remove the view entirely and be explicit in the controller that there's nothing else to render. [I found some examples of how to do this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45581659/105451), e.g.

```ruby
def offline
  flash.now[...]
  ...
  render :html => nil, :layout => true
end
```

I did it but it broke that test:
```
  # Test the offline page
  def test_offline
    get offline_path
    assert_response :success
    assert_template ""offline""
  end
```
Do I have to delete the test, since I've deleted `offline.html.erb`?

Keep the test, it's still required. The final assertion no longer makes sense and needs to be adjusted - I would change it to no longer asserting that a particular template is used (since we aren't using a view), but to change it to ensure that the layout is still rendered, since we need the layout to make sure the flash message is displayed. 

There are examples of asserting the layout elsewhere in the test directory.

I've updated the test and it seems to be working.

Instead of a squashing & rewriting, it might be desirable to judge the backportability of dependencies and restrict the differences to just C++20.

I did squash all the commits of this PR. The removed methods in `get_num_acting_pgs()` do not exist in Q. Therefore, it resulted in an empty commit.

The difference is that the changes were not reverted in main - they were fixed in https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/49507.
However, in Q, the changes were reverted first and only then fixed (in this PR).

How do you suggest to handle this?

My understanding of events is following:

1. there was a bug fix that introduced a regression to both `main` and `quincy`.
2. In `main` the regression has been fixed by a follow-up while in `quincy` the PR got simply reverted. 
3. Therefore the `check_pg_num()` simplification substantially differs between `main` and `quincy`.

It looks that the quincy version has unsatisfied dependencies (the very original, reverted PR + the regression fix). If so, I would bring those commits again – it still might be clearer than a custom patch.

cherry-picked the reverted commits as well, Thanks for this suggestion!

The commit `mon/OSDMonitor: Make the pg_num check more accurate` lacks the `cherry picked from` info. Use `git cherry-pick -x <commit ID>`. Please also add it's being cherry-picked as dependency for other commits and mention it was reverted.

Needs `cherry-picked from`. What's weird it lacks `Fixes` too. How is it `main`?

`cherry-picked from` + the info why we're taking it.

Far, far easier to review now! :1st_place_medal: 

`Fixes` is missing in main as well https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/44430.

Understood.

Sorry, I've missed it last time – this commit is basically a fixup. When backporting the typical practice is to squash such changes while informing the main commit about any customization and the reason for it.

Showing more than 30 options on a select input would not be a very good experience 😄 

The branches are sorted by updated date and the default branch is always on top. If there are more than 30 branches we're forcing the user to type its name because GH API has no search functionality for branches, unfortunately.

The reason we didn't refetch on focus is that if the user switches tabs, they'll lose their current selection 😬

Try it:

1. select a branch that's not the default
2. switch tabs
3. check that the selection is gone and you're back to the default branch

@mpkelly could move that 30 into a constant in this PR. 

I'm the changing the logic which auto selects the branch to check for an existing selection.

I like @zaguiini's idea of changing the type of input based on the number of items.

Regarding the error, I'm in favor of showing the error explicitly, too (especially, since our disabled states for input fields are not accessible). It would be nice to find a less redundant message than the one below, though.

I think we can just leave the text field blank in this case.

A (!) red error is a bit more than I'd expect in this case. There's been no user error they should fix up, they haven't typed anything wrong. It feels more like an informational thing.

But I am definitely in favour of showing a more accessible message!

In general, in Matrix, we don't use integers to represent enumerations.  We usually use a set of string values instead.  e.g. ""exclude_sources"" can be one of ""remote"", ""local"", or ""none"", defaulting to ""none"".

While this doesn't mean that endpoints can't use integers, there would need to be a compelling reason for an endpoint to do so, and I don't think that the reason for using an integer is particularly strong in this case.  If you want to allow for the possibility of multiple things to be excluded in the future, the parameter can be made to be an array of things to exclude.

There should be an [""Unstable Prefix""](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/main/proposals/0000-proposal-template.md#unstable-prefix) section

oh, I wasn't aware of that convention. ""none"" makes little sense, IMHO: If it's a list / set of strings, just keep it empty.

Sorry, I don't understand. Not having written an implementation so far, I did not add that section.

You don't need to have written any implementation yet to define an unstable prefix.  But you should define an unstable prefix for use by anyone who does want to write an implementation.

Does this exist already or needs to be added?

You are thinking of a scenario where a new issue is added and the date is set, but the issue not published and the user wants to use remove it altogether? 

Testing steps:

1. Open the form and put `2022-02-03` into the date published field.
2. Click save.
3. Close form and re-open form.
4. Delete `2022-02-03` from the date published field.
5. Click save.
6. Close form and re-open form.

The date published field should be empty.

So this is what I am thinking of adding

 ```
       // If issue is not published, allow empty datePublished
        if (!$this->getData('datePublished') && !$issue->getPublished()){
            $issue->setDatePublished(NULL);
        }

        // If datePublished is set
        if ($this->getData('datePublished')) {
            $issue->setDatePublished($this->getData('datePublished'));
        }
```

If it works with the steps above, ok by me. What happens when an issue is published, though? Is there any error message when they try to edit the date published? Or does it just not change silently?

Note that this does not allow you to give an empty value for an issue that is published.

yes, that was missing

This looks good. However, I'd like to restructure the conditional block a little. Right now the `else` block corresponds to a very specific case: a future issue. But it's not that clear from reading the code. Can we structure this to be a little more explicit for reading?

```php
if ($issue) {
    if ($issue->getData('published')) {
        $publication->setData('status', Submission::STATUS_PUBLISHED);
        if (!$publication->getData('datePublished')) {
            $publication->setData('datePublished', $issue->getData('datePublished'));
        }
    } else {
        $publication->setData('status', Submission::STATUS_SCHEDULED);
    }
} else {
    $publication->setData('status', Submission::STATUS_PUBLISHED);
    if (!$publication->getData('datePublished')) {
        $publication->setData('datePublished', Core::getCurrentDate());
    }
}
```

It results in a little more conditional block nesting. But I think it's easier to interpret what is happening in each block.

Can you move this comment to the docblock and make it the following:

```php
/**
 * Set the status and date of publication
 *
 * A publication's status and date of publication will be set depending
 * on the issue it is assigned to. Publications in future issues should
 * be set to `STATUS_SCHEDULED`. Otherwise, they should be set to
 * `STATUS_PUBLISHED` and should inherit the date of publication from the 
 * issue, unless a date of publication has already been set.
 *
 * Usually, the date of publication will be set when the issue is
 * published. In some unusual cases, a publication may be published 
 * without an issue. This may happen in a continuous publishing model 
 * where articles are published right away. In these cases, the date of 
 * publication should be set to the current date, unless a date of 
 * publication has already been set.
 */
```

Do you need to add a check to the `validate()` method when `!$this->getData('datePublished') && $issue->getPublished()`?

Looks good! Just want to note that again the last `else` is something that the current code base will never trigger. You will not get here without having an `issue` set. But it is definitely something we have been working towards. Just thinking that do we want to have this ""sleeping code"" here already now?

You mean if no `datePublished` is given, but `issue` is published, we should give a warning. I think at the moment you can't just remove the date and no warning is shown.

Maybe we need a check for a valid date as well? We did not have one formerly, but would probably make sense. I was just looking around and could not find if we have one somewhere already, I mean if there is an existing solution for validating date stamps.

That's a fair point, but if we left the `else` block out, we'd have an ""invisible"" condition. Calling `setStatusOnPublish()` for such a publication would do nothing. I'd prefer to fall back to a sensible default behavior that does what the function says it does (changing the status when something is published).

Yeah, so if someone removes the `datePublished` and clicks save, and the `datePublished` isn't removed, they need to see some message indicating that. Otherwise they will assume it's changed and then we have bad metadata.

I don't think we have one of the old form validators, but if you look at `ValidatorRegExp` you can see an example of using [Laravel's Validation Rules](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/validation#available-validation-rules). I think we'd want [date_format:format](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/validation#rule-date-format), something like this:

 ```php
$validator = ValidatorFactory::make(
    ['value' => $value],
    ['value' => ['required', 'date_format:Y-m-d']]
);

$result = $validator->passes();
```

You can also skip the `Validator` class and just add this to `IssueForm::validate()`.

sure agree!

The `datePublished` field is acting very weird. I think the `datepicker` functionality is affecting it.

I added `error_log(print_r($this->getData('datePublished'), true));` to the form `validation` method to see what I get there when I save the form.

```
Form input: (empty) -> Error output (empty) (this value is saved to the issue!)
Form input: 55 -> Error output (empty) (issue value still empty)
Form input: 2019-01 -> Error output (empty)  (issue value still empty)
Form input: 2019-01-01 -> Error output 2019-01-01 (this value is saved to the issue!)
Form input: 55 -> Error output 2019-01-01   (issue value still  2019-01-01)
Form input: 2019-01 -> Error output 2019-01-01 (issue value still  2019-01-01)
Form input: (empty) -> Error output (empty) (this value is saved to the issue!)
```

So it looks like there is some internal validation going on in the datepicker?

There may be client-side validation, but it can't replace server-side validation.

hmm, maybe it has something to do with the fact that datepicker creates another input to the form

yes, looking at the source with developer tools I can see that the `value` attribute in `input` is only updated when you enter a valid date.

so basically you can not get an invalid date from the form when you get to validation. The problem is of course that you won't see any error. It will just use the last valid value it had.

You can't rely on the UI to do validation because the user can send any data in the HTTP request. 

sure, but you can not get an invalid date at the moment to the validation method.

I had something like

```
        if ($this->getData('datePublished')) {

            $validator = ValidatorFactory::make(
               ['value' => $this->getData('datePublished')],
               ['value' => ['required', 'date_format:Y-m-d']]
            );

            if (!$validator->passes()){
                $this->addError('datePublished', __('editor.issues.datePublished.invalid'));
                $this->addErrorField('datePublished');
            }
        }
```

Not sure about the double """" here? Might have missed something.

possibly rephrase to ""best wishes to everyone"" or ""Sending well wishes to all of you"" 

Do you have a sign up or way to add something to a calendar? It's not at all necessary in order to send it out but might be nice to help lower the overhead of adding details and remembering.

Possibly move the image up to be below ""Introducing Alice"". 

And then below say ""In her own words...."" 

perhaps a trigger warning (it's not overly graphic but it might help). 

An option could be to have a sentence for the introduction of 
_Hear about Alice, her journey of getting diagnosed, and how she experiences what she calls her ""technicolour"" life:_ 

the TW could be ""emotional imagery"" and could come above this section of text. 

Just a bit of clean up formatting (there were floating >’s and a few extra quotation marks, and some spelling checks” 

Hear about Alice and her work with us here: 


""I'm a 47 year-old late-diagnosed autistic woman and mother. I am actually multiply neurodivergent: I'm autistic, and I have attention differences. My proudest achievement is that I'm a Mum to my daughter Isabell, who is also multiply neurodivergent. We live together in our home in Brighton with our cat Belle, who I say to my daughter is also autistic - and that's why I picked her, because she's very particular.""


""I think something interesting about my profile, which I think is becoming more and more common now, is I've lived life both sides of the river. I've lived for 46 years as a neurotypical person, and I've only lived the past year and a half knowing that I was autistic. Getting a diagnosis was life-changing for me. My motivation wasn't because I needed extra support, it was more because of curiosity, and because of my daughter. My diagnosis came as a positive thing, as a quest of curiosity and self-knowledge, rather than being because I was experiencing problems in my life. So that's actually quite an unusual thing. I wasn't ""diagnosed"" in that pathology paradigm of something being wrong. So for me, I think that's quite an interesting angle, that my diagnosis was about something more, it was about my strengths - but also so that I could locate some of the challenges that I'd previously experienced in my neurotypical life.""

""For me it's just a different way of being in the world, which describes my relationship to the world and people. I always grew up feeling different, and not really understanding why. I had different feelings about things, different reactions to things, and I felt like a refugee actually - which is quite interesting given my work. I felt dislocated and alienated. So when I got my diagnosis I could make sense of why I felt and thought differently. It was validating. A lot of the things I would criticise myself for, like that I couldn't understand things in the same way other people did, or that I couldn't think about things in the same way - can lead to really negative feelings about yourself, which can become a self-perpetuating cycle.""

""Some autistic people have quite switched off experiences, but for me, I experience life in glorious technicolour. Don't get me wrong, I'm not seeing things dancing - it's rooted in reality, but I see and feel things very intensely. My particular profile is I'm hyper-sensitive and hyper-emotional.

That impulsivity led me into something really positive - into risk-taking, because I thought, 'yeah, I'm going to set my own business up'.""

""For me, there's both 'despite of', and 'because of' with autism. Being autistic has led to challenges, but it's also opened doors to things and people and worlds I would never have imagined. I feel that it's something that I need to protect and honour and really take care of. It's like harbouring a very precious vase inside of you that you have to really take care of. When I got my diagnosis, it lead to compassion, so my diagnosis gave me self-understanding, and kindness to myself, whereas before I used to be very self-critical, feeling like I was doing things wrong. It was like looking in a kaleidoscope and then being able to switch my whole life, and see my life in a whole new way, going forwards.""

""My mates who are in the autistic community are trashing the old pathology paradigm around theory of mind and lack of empathy. Yes, there are some individuals on the spectrum, as there are some individuals not on the spectrum, who may have mental illness and may have a lack of empathy, but then there are people on the spectrum, just like there are people not on the spectrum, who have hyper-empathy, and in fact there's a huge emerging area of research - you have hypo and hyper - you can be more ""switched off"" and more ""switched on"", like me, and both can be a gift and a burden. It can be challenging, which is why you need to protect and look out for yourself. So I am of that school of thought, that every day lay notions of autism or autistic people lacking empathy or social skills, it's really old - it's dead.""

""With courage, I'm talking to people like you. I'm trying to raise awareness and change the profile, so that across communities and society there are changes in how we perceive neurodiversity. People like me, I have great social skills - I maybe talk too much, but I communicate highly effectively. I'm highly articulate, I have emotionality - a huge emotional landscape, so that I was able to found and sustain a social organisation working with loads of professionals who might have diagnosed me - doctors, psychiatrists, social workers.""

""The circles that I'm moving in: I'm moving in academic circles, because of my masters. I'm moving increasingly in professional circles. I am seeing the embracing of the new paradigm. But that has to filter down. So they are the thinkers and the doers in terms of structure. Where I don't see it is in the non-autistic community around me. That's not the case with my friends, luckily - probably because all my friends are neurodiverse, either diagnosed or undiagnosed. Also the kinds of people I would be friends with anyway are really open-minded. But I suppose as I'm navigating day to day life, sadly, there's still these really old misconceptions about autism amongst even the middle class intelligentsia, teachers, and all kinds. There's a lot of work to be done. But I do see it in academic and in organisational and professional circles.""

""I wonder, and I think maybe in 50 years time neurodivergent people are going to be the new neurotypicals, because it's such an emerging and growing area, and realising that human nature, what it is to be human, is not singular, and it's not binary. It's not, you know, male and female - gender is a huge construct, ethnicity, race. It's the same with neurodiversity. It's complex, and what it is to be human is not singular.""

""That is why intersectionality is so important, and neurology with other categories and dimensions, such as gender and class. Some of what I've been doing in my master's is around reframing and reclaiming those spaces, so you're not just autistic, you're, for instance, neuro-queer. So taking derogatory or pathologizing language and reclaiming it. That's what I'm really interested in, in terms of my research - all this myriad, and kaleidoscope - plus, plus, plus, plus, plus.”

""How I found out about this project was that it came up on Facebook. I'm invested in a lot of autistic organisations, such as The National Autistic Society and Autistica. I'd already looked at Autistica's website and seen a lot of what they did, and I've signed up to be involved in research. I feel this is a natural synergy. This popped up at around 6:30 which is a really random time for me even to be looking at stuff, and I was making something for my daughter, and I thought, ""wow, this is interesting"". Particularly because the whole sensory aspect of being neurodivergent is massively neglected. I listened to the talk. There were two bits of this: the fact that it's sensory and the participatory aspect - and then the extension of that, which is citizen science - I thought, 'wow'. I like anything which is pioneering, anything that's cutting edge. Because I'm a CEO, I like seeing patterns of what's new and emerging. So I'm involved because I feel that this project is in an exciting, emerging area, and because we know that this is what autistic people have told us feels important to them. It's massively under-researched. So I thought, ""yes, I really, really want to do this, I really want to participate in this"". I actually feel that it's a commitment and a responsibility to change things for other people, so I really want to be involved.""

This plugin could swing between being useful to unusable depending on how difficult this is to setup.

An alternative would be adapters for Maxmind files and allow users to implement adapters for other data sources.

Any GDPR concerns that should be mentioned?

It looks like we could bundle the plugin with a [GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) database if we need to make it work out of the box. This is a smaller, less accurate free version of their GeoIP database product. The full product requires a license and subscription to use.

I think most of the GDPR rules generally apply to data at rest, i.e., logs, customer records etc. It should be OK to use this data right away in a live website, but it might be problematic to generate logs of who was visiting from where. But if a site logs IP addresses, they could run geoip offline later anyway.

I think using this library has caused problems with the fusion build system since it imports a file from disk (or something like that, I don't recall the details but I think it causes our builds to print out ""Warning: custom Babel config is an unstable API and may be not be supported in future releases. Use at your own risk."").

It seems like [node-geoip](https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip) is the most popular JS library for interfacing with the maxmind database. Unfortunately this library requires transforming the database from the maxmind format but says it has better performance. I'm not sure if this is a good time to try migrating to this library.

If there's a benchmark that demonstrates node-geoip is faster, I'm fine with using that. Otherwise, I think it should be OK to use maxmind-db-reader in the near term. We can fork it and/or send a PR upstream to fix the warning.

Good idea.

It is indeed a very good idea to keep this in it's own function, even though it's a one-liner, because this way it is much clearer what it is supposed to be doing.

The spacing in the map function call is inconsistent, choose either `call( argument );` or `call(argument);`, but not `call( argument);`.

Spacing as mentioned before.

Maybe we could make this an interface/class? It is being used rather quite a lot.

Spacing.

This will be rewritten in the future, allowing for a much more elegant way to do this.

Why the relocation? Also please maintain the spacing.

Usually this is placed at the top of the class.

Good catch

The formatting here is off. I would recommend

```ts
.subscribe({
    error: e => console.log(e)
});
```
or
```ts
.subscribe(()=>{}, (e) => console.log(e));
```

Indentation inconsistent.

Same comment on formatting.

I think the naming of this class could use some work. What do you think of SubscriptionHolder?

This was a linter thing i am affraid. I have placed them back and it doesn't give me the same warning anymore so i am not exactly sure why it was that it wanted it back in front.

this was changed due to my linter giving this:
Declaration of instance field not allowed after declaration of instance method. Instead, this should come at the beginning of the class/interface. (member-ordering)tslint(1)

I thought just subscriptions would be clear enough, since it is just the subscriptions. However i am also fine with the SubscriptionHolder name since that also acuratly describes what it does.

```suggestion
(the `m.room.create` event is immutable and can't be changed retroactively).
```

There's another thing to consider here. If we allow a subsequent state event to change the predecessor, then a state reset can potentially reset it to an earlier value, or even make different homeservers observe different values. Moreover, this can happen even without a state reset in case of conditions such as a network split.

Obviously we should eradicate state resets, making this much rarer, but it's somewhat intrinsic to the MSC that situations like this can happen, as soon as we allow dynamically changing the predecessor.

Perhaps this isn't a problem, but I think it's worth mentioning.

I'm a bit worried this MSC introduces higher risk of security issues in clients regarding room takeovers. Currently, the relationship between the previous and current room can be verified (barring state resets), giving the client confidence that room B is in fact the most recent edition of room A. With the relationship being mutable, clients are likely to not check the predecessor correctly and therefore allow someone to hide/take over non-tombstoned rooms.

The current relationship of rooms is very linear, and though this MSC says the mutable event takes precedence, not all clients will have updated to consider that point. This can lead to inconsistencies in what users see, or abusive scenarios where rooms are hidden from some people and not others.

(I think we race conditioned a bit and share [more-or-less the same concern](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3946#discussion_r1062703513), just worded a bit differently.)

I'm slightly more concerned about clients getting the implementation wrong, despite warnings in the spec, though yes: the root issue is ""mutable is scary"", I think.

Resolving in favor of the other thread, https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3946#discussion_r1062714169

> Currently, the relationship between the previous and current room can be verified (baring state resets), giving the client confidence that room B is in fact the most recent edition of room A.

There is nothing ""verifiable"" about the `m.room.create` `predecessor` value besides that it came from someone with proper power levels. A Matrix room can be created with whatever predecessor desired (even multiple rooms with the same predecessor). And same for the tombstone from some old room pointing to a new room. And as a note in case onlookers aren't as familiar, tombstones are already mutable.

To me, the chain of tombstone and predecessor are mere suggestions of where you can continue looking at history in the room. I'm not quite following the line of thought to get the severity with danger in any of this.

All of these problems like selectively sharing the state only to certain servers or state resets seem completely separate to this MSC. If we can't trust the state in a room, then everything falls apart.



The presence of a tombstone pointing to the new room and a predecessor pointing to the tombstoned room forms a verifiable relationship - this was specifically designed in for room upgrades. 

With this MSC, we'd be breaking that relationship we previously went out of our way to make verifiable - this is where the concern is coming from. If we're breaking the verifiable nature of the relationship, it needs to be for justifiable/secure reasons. 

We already acknowledge that state resets and similar can cause the relationship to be broken, however the expectation in those cases is that clients actually split the room into two logical rooms again, even if half the relationship still exists. With both halves of the relationship, the client can merge the rooms together safely.

Reference:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1190097/211438371-1fb0aaa6-bc3a-4dcd-ae4f-baa0b1edc34c.png)

In this diagram, if a user is joined to all 3 rooms then what should happen is Room B and Room A are treated as a single room (Room B, specifically), and Room C is treated as its own room. With this MSC, the risk becomes that Room C ""takes over"" the relationship, thus making all 3 rooms represented by Room C, despite Room B never intending for that to happen.

State resets can also do this, but are a known problem and indeed irrelevant as far as this discussion is concerned.

Are there notes somewhere in the spec or wherever about what you're describing as ""verifiable"". From usage, it doesn't appear that way to me at all.

I can already create Room C with the predecessor of Room B without this MSC. Nothing seems ""verifiable"" about that.

`POST /_matrix/client/v3/createRoom`

```json
{
    ""creation_content"": {
        ""predecessor"": ""!abc:foo.bar""
    },
    ""preset"": ""public_chat"",
    ""name"": ""predecessor_test1""
}
```

And this MSC doesn't change the linear linked-list relationship with tombstones and predecessors that already exists.


It's possible to create such a room, just as it's possible to create a tombstone event that goes nowhere (or a room avatar with invalid media reference, or a message without `body`, etc). The current spec is incredibly vague because it was written in an era where that happened more than we would have liked: https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#client-behaviour-27

There might be some history in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1791 (the spec PR) as it looks like there was some back and forth on the PR (because that was also legal in the spec process at the time), and the original MSC was https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1502 (note that it's technically MSC1501, for reasons of process at the time). There's also more discussion at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/1425 which might be useful.

I haven't looked in depth, but it appears the sentence you're after isn't described explicitly, but rather implicitly. Because the client is expected to make an effort to hide the old room from the user, it is also expected to ensure malicious predecessor structures the user has visibility on do not override rooms (as that would be a takeover). 

The js-sdk's implementation of this verification is togglable, as it somewhat depends on the scenario where it's being used: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/blob/424212cd6546a00b606380f10ae2585d1d43e518/src/client.ts#L5015

Similar filtering is done by the js-sdk when determining the true set of ""visible"" rooms (used by the room list algorithms in the react-sdk layer): https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/blob/424212cd6546a00b606380f10ae2585d1d43e518/src/client.ts#L3768

In short, the verification happens client-side at the moment (which is regrettable, but there's much more inferred history to room upgrades that made this reality - I can dig into it internally if interested, though it doesn't affect this MSC).

----

fwiw, some of this concern is driven by the MSC's problem statement: it's not entirely clear what exact problem is being solved here, and some out of band poking has revealed a few more details about the real-world case for this. In practice, it looks like Gitter will be migrating chat history into Matrix and would like to do that in a clean way. The proposed solution appears to be that a MSC2716-compatible room will be created, history imported, tombstoned, and retroactive predecessor set on the already-existing room to point to the MSC2716-compatible room.

Assuming that's accurate (please correct me if not), there are a few concerns/questions/suggestions regarding the approach:
1. In order to guarantee any amount of durability on the imported history, Gitter would need to be using a stable room version to import the history into. Currently, MSC2716 is unstable and Synapse drops unstable room versions when the feature is included in a stable version, intentionally and regardless of usage. This will mean that eventually, when/if MSC2716 gets adopted into a stable room version, the history will be lost to time. It also means the history would only be accessible by Synapse currently, as no other server to my knowledge implements the unstable room version.
2. MSC2716 has a backwards compatibility case to allow importing history into existing rooms, as the room creator. From what I remember, all of the Gitter rooms were created by a service account: this service account could be used to import history into the already-existing room version, therefore not requiring a second room to be involved.
3. If the Gitter service account doesn't have creator access in enough of the rooms, but the Gitter server can upgrade the room, an option would be to upgrade the room in-place to a MSC2716-supported version (ideally stable, for reasons described in no. 1 above), import the history into the *new* room, and continue using the room normally (or upgrade it again for a clean slate): this gives the benefit of time-accurate history (not necessarily DAG-accurate, which clients don't care about anyways) while also requiring no changes to room upgrades. 

The value of a dynamic predecessor is definitely present, I think, though the security concern of room takeovers has me worried. Having written this short thesis of a comment, I don't really have many good ideas on how to fix it right now, but believe it can be done. In the meantime, hopefully one of the suggestions/considerations for the real-world usecase are useful.

> In short, the verification happens client-side at the moment (which is regrettable, but there's much more inferred history to room upgrades that made this reality - I can dig into it internally if interested, though it doesn't affect this MSC).

I don't see a problem where this MSC conflicts with any of this. The client can still do its merging and ""verification"" as necessary. And the client getting it wrong is not a dire scenario. It just results in two rooms being shown. This ""verification"" is even toggleable as you mentioned so it's not core to anything.


> fwiw, some of this concern is driven by the MSC's problem statement: it's not entirely clear what exact problem is being solved here, and some out of band poking has revealed a few more details about the real-world case for this. 

The MSC describes the import use case that I will be using this for but it's [not with MSC2716](https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2313#why-arent-we-using-msc2716).

For Gitter, we're using the single `/send?ts=123` endpoint with timestamp massaging. We're creating a separate historical room, importing the message history one by one, tombstoning to point to the ""live"" room and want to use this MSC to have the ""live"" room's predecessor point back to the historical room.

A client getting it wrong means the room has been taken over, which is very much against our threat model for Matrix (for better or worse). This MSC allows for dynamic predecessors, but clients trying to apply their verification logic to the linked list will end up treating the proposed usecase as two isolated rooms instead of a single room.

If this could be clarified in the MSC, it would be appreciated. The current intention of the MSC is unclear and appears to tell a different story than what is actually planned.

How is this a takeover? Above all, this is just a client display thing. And second, it looks like one room needs the tombstone and other one needs a predecessor for things to look replaced. Both sides acknowledged each other for this to happen. Anything other than this seems like a bad assumption on the clients part.

I can update it to spell it out more plainly 👍




I'm not sure this is wrong 🤔 (more opinions/knowledge needed)

Both sides acknowledged each other for this to happen. Anything other than this seems like a bad assumption on the clients part.

The case I'm concerned about isn't when both rooms point at each other, but rather when a client developer inevitably makes a mistake in the implementation of this MSC. There's already significant risk of clients getting the implementation wrong, and making the predecessor dynamic opens the door wider for mistakes (despite warnings in the spec, which often go unheeded). This would result in a malicious room being allowed to overwrite/hide another room it shouldn't have right to, thus takeover.

""retroactively"" is more correct as the subject is being looked at without consideration.

This seems like it would be a client doing something very wrong. We can't help a client that doesn't look at both `tombstone` and `predecessor` to see that they match. That's a bare minimum even with the current state of `tombstone`/`predecessor` if you're making rooms look replaced. A client can show the pointer forward/backward without this verification though.

Even a naive client implementation that only looks at the create event for the `predecessor` is safe in the new world that this MSC creates.

If a client implementation updates to look at `m.room.predecessor`, then that is also pretty fool-proof regardless of which era of state they look at. The only tricky thing I could think of is if we also lived in a [MSC3779](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3779) world where someone doesn't check for the canoncial version with `state_key: """"` but that's not a concern yet (and is a general problem).

We seem to use `retrospectively` more often in the spec than `retroactively` in scenarios like this (just searching all of the MSC's in this repo)

Judging from https://english.stackexchange.com/a/148988/103469, it seems like `retroactively` fits better since an action is being taken to change things.

I agree that the client would be doing something wrong, however the risk of a client doing something wrong is higher with an MSC like this (in its current form) that overall leaves an impression that the protocol is insecure, even if the blame is actually with the clients. 

Unfortunately I don't recall all of the details, but there was also a reason why we embedded the predecessor into the create event instead of a dedicated state event: a dedicated state event would have been cleaner and ""more proper"" as far as Matrix is concerned, but we landed on putting it in the create event for a reason. Digging up that rationale would likely help this conversation, as it keeps coming to mind, though I sadly do not have the bandwidth to do that research.

I don't think this MSC increases the risk level. We have the exact same risk with the current `tombstone`/`predecessor` state of things.

And to address that one aspect, it sounds we should consider another MSC to verify this server-side so clients can more easily rely on eating whatever we feed it.

This would be interesting to find. We should start a new thread if we come up with anything here.


One datapoint around verifiability: I found a bug in matrix-js-sdk's code for verifying links: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/3089 . The fact that this has remained undiscovered for a long time may imply that people are not paying a great deal of attention to verifiability.

@MadLittleMods did you consider including event_id like in the create event? Some code in matrix-react-sdk expects to be able to have that. I'm not sure yet what the implications would be of not providing it when looking for a room's predecessor. (I imagine we can work around it, but I haven't looked into it yet)

> did you consider including event_id like in the create event?

Didn't know about it so no consideration was given to it so far. For my own reference: https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#mroomcreate

> `event_id` (**Required**): The event ID of the last known event in the old room.
> `room_id` (**Required**): The ID of the old room.

Adding an optional `last_known_event_id` field seems fine 👍

I assume it's not related to the upgrade verification part at all since we should be looking at the latest state in the room. But this sort of info could be nice as one option for a continuation point to jump to in the old room.

It terms of workaround fallbacks, we can just go to where the latest tombstone in the old room is or just the latest in the old room. One more complicated option is to use the `/timestamp_to_event` endpoint to find the latest event from when the predecessor was sent but doesn't seem necessary or the right thing to do exactly.


Without a via list this is likely to be unjoinable over federation as room_ids are not routable. https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/2925 for context.

One desired use case with this is to allow users to view and access a predecessor room they haven't been in before, and which their homeserver likely doesn't know about.

@t3chguy Just confirmed my suspicions that to join such rooms, the room id isn't enough, we'd also need the vias or a room alias. Which means the vias should be included at least in the dynamic predecessor message. As the static room predecessor message doesn't include vias either, use of that likely should be phased out.

(As requested, I've moved the comment to a separate thread)

(moving this comment to this thread)

This makes a lot of sense! 👍

Added a `via_servers` field to the `m.room.predecessor` event in the proposal

So I understand the use cases, are my assumptions above correct? Are there other use cases? Is this useful?

IMO this should be `via` for consistency with already specced shapes, e.g. `m.space.child`. https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#mspacechild

There is also [`/join/{roomIdOrAlias}?server_name=foo.bar`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3joinroomidoralias).

I can update this to be whatever name we want to start being consistent about. Thanks for that link, https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/appendices/#routing is also an interesting reference.

I chose `via_servers` because it seemed like the best plainly readable thing and pretty much self-explains what the content should be.



The reasoning for this is that, even if the via servers were specified in the room.create event, they'd quickly go out of date, as the room.create event is immutable.

Whenever via servers change, the dynamic room predecessor event can be updated with new via information, though.

As result, even if the room.create event were updated to include via servers, phasing it out would still be recommended.

We might want to add more of the aforementioned context in the spec as well, potentially as suggested guidance on when dynamic predecessor events should be updated as well.

Added 👍

Thanks for the extra notes!

That way if a caller passes nullptr for def_val, this method will not mess with the expected return value.

Thanks @vedanshbhartia for your feedback, I've just made another commit fixes this.

i looked at the calling code: rgw_rest.h, rgw_auth_s3.h/cc, rgw_rest_client.cc
all of these places interpret `def_val=nullptr` as ""not found without default value"".
this means, that any change to the return value would break the existing logic.

so, i think there could be several options:
* leave the things as they are (maybe add a commend at rgw_common.h saying that this function returns nullptr if value is not found and default value is not provided. and still have the risk of dereferencing a nullptr
* change the return type to `cosnt std::string&`. since the internal map already holds `std::string`, it may make sense to return it from the function. and pass empty string as the default value
* or, to avoid confusion between an empty string, and a missing value, i would not go for an empty string as the missing value, instead, i would return `std::optiona<std::string>` which clearly indicated whether a value exists or not, and have two overloads of the function, one with a default, and one without


Thanks @yuvalif for looking into the calling code and providing options for the return type of the function. I appreciate your thorough analysis.

Regarding the options you suggested, I understand the potential confusion between an empty string and a missing value. I think using `std::optional<std::string>` as the return type is a good solution as it clearly indicates whether a value exists or not. Having two overloads of the function, one with a default and one without, would also be helpful.

I've chosen the second option replacing by changing the return type to `const std::string&` and made a commit for that.

Please let me know if you need any further changes or if everything looks good now.







there's a [`RGWHTTPArgs::get_optional()`](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/blob/9ec470a/src/rgw/rgw_common.h#L360-L361) that behaves this way, except instead of `std::optional<std::string>` it returns `boost::optional<const std::string&>` to return a reference instead of a copy

if you use `get_optional()` you probably don't need to also do the check in line 454.
this would also save on doing the lookup twice

```suggestion
    auto token = info.env->get_optional(""HTTP_X_AMZ_SECURITY_TOKEN"");
```

```suggestion
  if (!d || !parse_iso8601(d, &t, NULL, false)) {
```

you can probably embed this check in line 444, and remove from here

you should probably move it up to uts original location. so that the order of the output json does not change

you can probably make `copy_source` an optional string, and in `RGWPutObj_ObjStore_S3::send_response()` check on it instead of checking `copy_source.empty()`

just use `grt_optional()` no need to check `exists()`

```suggestion
      auto token = s->info.env->get_optional(""HTTP_X_AMZ_SECURITY_TOKEN"");
```

same comment

```suggestion
    auto server_port = s->info.env->get_optional(""SERVER_PORT_SECURE"");
```

@yuvalif Why use auto instead?

it is alwasy better to define and set a variable at the same time, using the ""auto"" keyword is just a side benefit from that (shorter code), but if you prefer to be explicitm, you can do:
```cpp
 boost::optional<const std::string&> token = info.env->get_optional(""HTTP_X_AMZ_SECURITY_TOKEN"");
```

Thanks for sharing! Let's go with `auto`

@yuvalif  but that means there are subsequent changes we need to make as in [rgw_op.h](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/blob/main/src/rgw/rgw_op.h#LL1196C1-L1196C27) `copy_source` is defined as `std::string` not `boost::optional<const std::string&>`?

One of the biggest features that needs restricted on bridges is the set of allowed reactions. For example, iMessage only allows 5 reactions. I would be interested to see if this proposal could be adapted to handle that use-case.

Hmm, this should probably be its own MSC, because it sounds like it's going to be its own can of worms (a whitelist like this, blacklist, only allowing emojis, unicode versions, ...).

At the risk of bikeshedding too much, I'm wondering if we should call this ""reduced featureset"" modes or something? I'm just wondering if ""poorer"" is a good multi-lingual phrase.

Anyway, my 2c.

It's a reference to Matthew's original ticket (""disable richer features"") ;)

Maybe ""feature availability preferences,"" although that uses some long words

I wonder if it would make sense to have the spec say that a server impl should refuse a cleartext fallback if `m.encrypt` is present.

While this doesn't protect against people modifying their servers this would protect against faulty client implementations. 

On further thinking and talking to people: wouldn't it make sense to even enforce this in the auth rules? Is there any case where checking wouldn't be trivial or where you need plaintext next to encrypted? 

Reasoning behind doing this via auth rules would be that this is a security concern. So this would prevent a security relevant issue which would justify having strict validation of the event imho as security outweighs most use cases I can think of. 

indeed, though the concern is more that someone will stick `m.markup` as a fallback on an encrypted event, which defeats the purpose of encryption. This proposal as-is also theoretically allows for weird parts of the event to be encrypted, though that's not intended to be valid.

At this stage, auth rules feel overly strict for the general protocol: while I can agree with the principle that information should be enforced as encrypted, the general purpose nature of the protocol would call for a less constraining approach. 

Also at this stage, I currently believe that adding auth rules to specific event types would be a design failure. Ideally, there aren't exceptions.

I don't love the variable-type `ciphertext` in the old `m.room.encrypted` schema. Could it be split up into separate fields or something?

The example event uses Olm rather than Megolm. Does this MSC also cover a replacement for `m.room.encrypted` in to-device events?

toDevice is message-based, not event-based. 

Extensible Events does not consider toDevice in scope.

as mentioned in your other comment, it looks like I copy/pasted the wrong example. Not sure we can split up a string.

But if I'm understanding your question right: the reason to call `SetServerNameIfPresent` even if `pThis->remoteSNI == NULL`, is to set a default SNI (the value of the `target` parameter to `omfwd`, if it's not an IP address) if no SNI is specified in configuration.

Thanks for the explanation (Y).


sleep should be avoided except absolutely necessary - CI can be very slow and using fixed timing almost always leads to false positives

Ah, okay. Sorry for the delay - holidays etc. - I'm still working on figuring out why the tests are failing on certain distros.

I am currently working on the CI. Due to this, there is a higher rate of flakes than usual.  That said, you also need to rebase to current master. Otherwise we are no longer able to do CI runs (see merge conflicts below).

Enabling it by default is also not an option, because that causes GDPR issues for people using this as a base image...
And asking is also bad because it blocks script execution.

So the only option is to disable it by default.

The most prudent path is indeed to **disable** CEIP, by default.

```

`_search_regex()` already raises unless passed `fatal=False`:
```suggestion
```

Use a [different parameter name instead of `id`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77552/id-is-a-bad-variable-name-in-python), say `item_id`.

If `extract_api_data()` is only meant to be used in this class or its subclasses, call it `_extract_api_data()`.

These can fail in other ways than `KeyError`. Should those be trapped too? Eg:
```py
            ...
        except ExtractorError:
            raise
        except Exception:
            raise ExtractorError('%s: Invalid JSON' % id)
```


Needed later:
```suggestion
    strip_or_none,
    traverse_obj,
```

Optional metadata must not crash (add `traverse_obj` to utils imports):
```suggestion
        visual = traverse_obj(api_data, ('visual', 'src'), expected_type=url_or_none)
```

```suggestion
            timestamp = parse_iso8601(self._html_search_meta('article:published_time', webpage, 'publication time'))
```

Should this fail if `page_number == 0` (or, should the test be `is not None`)?

De-dupe:
```suggestion
            entries = []
            for d in ('prev', 'next'):
                if direction not in ('both', d) or playlist_data.get(d) is None:
                    continue
                webpage, other_api_data = self.get_data(
                    playlist_url, 'path', playlist_id,
                    page=page_number + (1 if d == 'next' else -1))
                entries.extend(
                    self.get_playlist_entries(playlist_url, playlist_id, other_api_data, direction=d))
```

Simplify and (more important) avoid crashing on unexpected `api_data`:
```suggestion
        url = traverse_obj(api_data, ('manifestations', 0, 'url'), expected_type=url_or_none)
        return (url, int_or_none(api_data['manifestations'][0].get('duration')) if not url else (None, None)
```
If `url` is valid, we know that `api_data['manifestations'][0]` is a `dict`, or at least something that can have `.get(...)` invoked on it.

Avoid crashing:
```suggestion
        entries = []
        for item in traverse_obj(api_data, ('expressions', 'items', Ellipsis), expected_type=dict):
```
If I got this right (?), it should ensure that the `[_]get_xxx()` methods are safe to call (see comment above).

Avoid crash in diagnostic:
```suggestion
                self.report_warning('No path found for episode ""%s""', item.get('title') or '[unknown]')
```

`_get_title()`?

In this method, as in all the following ones with `api_data` as a parameter, `api_data` has to be a `dict`. So either all calls have to be reviewed (best), or each method needs a change like:
```diff
-        title = strip_or_none(api_data.get('title'))
+        title = traverse_obj(api_data, 'title', expected_type=strip_or_none)

```

`_get_description()`?

`_get_thumbnail()`?

`_get_timestamp()`

`_get_brand()`?

`_extract_episode()`?

`_get_playlist_entries()`?

`_get_data()`?

Change the parameter name `id`, as before.

What should happen if this fails? Eg:
```suggestion
        webpage = self._download_webpage(url, id, query=query, note=note, fatal=False) or ''
```

Do you mean (ie, how many `/` are allowed?):
```suggestion
    _VALID_URL = r'https?://www\.radiofrance\.fr/(?:francemusique|franceinter|franceculture|franceinfo|mouv|fip)/podcasts/[^/]+/[^/]+-(?P<id>\d+)$'
```

Needed later:
```suggestion
from .common import InfoExtractor
from ..compat import compat_str
```

```suggestion
            'description': compat_str,
```

Good enough for the next 9076 years ...
```suggestion
            'upload_date': r're:\d{8}',
```
Or more specific:
```suggestion
            'upload_date': r're:\d{4}(?:0[1-9]|1[012])(?:[012][1-9]|[123]0|31)',
```

```suggestion
            'description': compat_str,
```

Or:
```suggestion
            entries.append({
                'id': episode_id,
                'url': episode_url,
                'title': self.get_title(item),
                'description': self.get_description(item),
                'timestamp': self.get_timestamp(item),
                'thumbnail': self.get_thumbnail(item),
                'duration': duration,
            })
```

Is this an assertion?
```suggestion
            assert False, 'Unexpected api_path ""%s""' % (api_path, )
```

Or:
```suggestion

        return {
            'id': id,
            '_type': 'playlist',
            'entries': reversed(entries),
```

`_get_livestream_formats()`?

Change `id` parameter name, as before.

Avoid crashing:
```suggestion
        formats = []
        for source in traverse_object(api_data, ('media', 'sources', Ellipsis), expected_type=dict):
            url = url_or_none(source.get('url'))
```

```suggestion
            'is_live': True,
```

```suggestion
        live_id = self._match_id(url)
```
etc

Still needed in yt-dl, especially as `preference` was set, and raises if `formats` is empty.
```suggestion
        self._sort_formats(formats)
```
Or allow empty `formats` to be returned and call `_sort_formats()` in the caller.

To customise the error message, specialise `_sort_formats()` in the base class:
```py
    def _sort_formats(self, formats, *args, **kwargs):
        try:
            return super(RadioFranceBaseIE, self)._sort_formats(self, formats, *args, **kwargs)

ops. All of these should be `<env>` so they can be overriden by env vars

I agree environment variables would be better, but some tests (e.g. `Extensions_Selenium2TestCaseMultipleBrowsersPropertyTest`) use these constants in their property declaration. Unfortunately you can't use `getenv` or `$_ENV` there. A workaround would be to use envrionment variables in `phpunit.xml.dist` and define all constants based on those variables in `phpunit-selenium-bootstrap.php`, but in my opinion that's not a really nice solution.

very interesting / possible tension with earlier proposal? 

I think scenario here is quite important - company collection of data from: 

- their own workers 
- their independent providers / contractors 
- workers for another company, or some other captive / compelled population 
- consumers of their products 

these are all currently different types of data providers, and while it may not be necessary at this point, I think elucidating the difference between these scenarios and the data collected in each one might help address some conflicting perspectives (i.e. remunerate people for their data, but move away from service-for-data business model) - kate

possible connection to labor intelligence / coop-supporting institute proposal - kate

possible tension between this view and later proposal from DSC Wiesbaden re: commercial payment of data providers? I see the proper valuation / remuneration of data being a big topic, and the concern raised by the authors here re: vulnerable populations is quite valid. - kate

there are a number of studies, and teaching methods don't appear to be the main issue - this proposal requires some follow-up - kate

nteresting thought - gets at tradeoff between data protection for content consumers vs utility for value attribution to content creators - kate

a strong claim - not sure that I would endorse in present form / without additional qualifications (just supporting open source doesn't go far enough toward a sustainable model for me). Joren's our IP expert, maybe he can take on this proposal? - kate

Patents also have their useful aspects. I would suggest to work on societal taxes and dividends for redistribution, this way the gains the corps had through public research flows back to the citizen. See also 'European New Deal'. - lynx

Interesting! - subliminal guy

Other pillar? - subliminal guy

I wouldn't want DiEM25 to make such a statement as it would accept and acknowledge that citizen and consumers become more transparent while that isn't actually necessary for anything, it has no societal benefit and should be forbidden by law. Still, even if we defend the privacy of people it is still important for humanity to improve transparency of corporations (other pillar however). - lynx

In my opinion this is only radical prose and not politically clever – We should concentrate on different business models or public funded solutions - subliminal guy

Outlawing advertising is a worthwhile thought. It is rarely ever used to inform us of the existence of some new product and most of the time manipulating us, especially everyone below 20 years of age or so (when advertising actually works best — check research on the subject). This is beyond the scope of our pillar, but we could certainly forbid all kinds of surveillance-based and individualised advertisement built on psychological manipulation by disabling certain features of HTTP and Javascript *by law*. No web browser is allowed to support them. No web server in Europe must try to employ them. - lynx

I was mostly referring to sentences like ""People wanting more and not being happy with what they have."" Such a statement belongs to blunted discussions in the park while drinking Carlsberg and Beck's and wearing nike sneakers and H&M shorts combined with a ""insert-your-favorite-hipster-brand""-shirt

We should avoid such language in our paper as it is based on non-proven claims and is not helpful in establishing a public discourse - subliminal guy

> sustainable projects

Sustainable in what sense? - subliminal guy

Off-topic? - lynx

Probably true, but do we have scientific material on the subject? And does it belong to this pillar? - lynx

Patchworky proposal. Is there any scientific sociologic backing to doing things this way? Liquid democracy at least has http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07723 speaking for it. Also, representation doesn't work. - lynx

EC might indeed take care of that, but it is only a secondary problem. The main problem is how the advertising and online markets were allowed to converge onto just 5 gatekeeper companies (plus 2 in China). - lynx

We could require that all smartphone apps must also be usable from any computer. Technically this is already possible, but hardly anyone has an Android emulator on their laptop. - lynx

This seems to be asking for an exchange standard, not a legislation. Standard document formats however exist, also means for upload — so if the industry hasn't established a standard practice in this field maybe that's because they have no economic incentive to do so? A legal policy could make it mandatory for publishing platforms to accept a uniform simple document upload format. Not clear to me which political problem this really addresses. - lynx

If we let humanity live on in the mine field of an unregulated Internet, then we need to spend billions in educating the teachers so that they actually know what they are talking about. Probably easier to change the Internet so that it no longer is a mine field. Then *nobody* has to learn encryption tools, and *nobody* has to understand why they are necessary. The ""alternative"" would become the default as mandated by legislation (#ObCrypto). - lynx

This is not an accurate description on how the big 5 became monopolies. - lynx

Free/Open Source software was one of the winning ingredients of Google and subsequent monopolists. When it came to making a product they moved the code to the private realm, just like it is described with research above. FLOSS alone is not the solution, it needs supporting legislation. - lynx

DiEM is not in government, therefore it should not confuse electorate with ""preliminary"" steps. It should promote the long-term vision for fair technology that doesn't suck. Proprietary technology should not be legal for any societally critical applications. - lynx

Copyright abolition would not solve this problem. Content goes viral using one specific URL and whoever has that copy makes all the money. Still, the idea of going back to ""broadcast"" is very good and the way to achieve could be to (a) make it mandatory to distribute websites by multicast pubsub instead of HTTP (see https://secushare.org/pubsub or IPFS for that), (b) make targeted advertising illegal and (c) introduce a mandatory anonymous micropayment system by which *any* article can be bought anonymously for a few cents. See https://taler.net for the most promising payment system in that regard. - lynx

Yes, and forbid proprietary code in all societally essential systems, therefore giving any programmer on Earth a decent chance to find vulnerabilities by reading *source code* rather than disassembling machine code. - lynx

Oh yeah! We need funding to *create* a truly distributed and private social network. None of the existing softwares can actually replace Facebook *technically*. In most cases they are just yet another server you have to trust. See https://secushare.org - lynx

Why? And is it enough if it is just a right and not an obligation? For the defense of democracy it probably must be mandatory to anonymise or at least pseudonymise digital activity. - lynx

This can actually be solved technically and should be mandated by law. See https://youbroketheinternet.org/programme for details. - lynx

Spare a few details that are too detailed you just pretty accurately described the GNUnet/secushare project.  <3  The YBTI proposals for legislation aim at obtaining this kind of Internet instead of the current borken one. Instead of asking money to be spent in making this system we recommend to make it a necessary requirement so that the entire industry MUST work on solving this challenge: the challenge for an ethically acceptable Internet. - lynx

Breaking up the monopolists would need to be repeated yearly as the digital market tends to recreate new monopolists. The best way to prevent trading of data is to not let anyone *have* any data to trade — otherwise trade will happen, either legally or in the darknet, simply because the data is there and there is no evidence of it being abused or stolen. - lynx

Yes, but how? - lynx

This assumes GDPR actually achieves the goal. See https://youbroketheinternet.org/GDPR for a criticism why GDPR may in large part fail to actually achieve the intended goals. - lynx

Yes I already boiled it down in the actual green paper draft ... Glad you like it, tho ... Most of it comes from Maidsafe's specs. I only added the EU as facilitator ...

there are a number of studies, and teaching methods don't appear to be the main issue - this proposal requires some follow-up - kate

nteresting thought - gets at tradeoff between data protection for content consumers vs utility for value attribution to content creators - kate

a strong claim - not sure that I would endorse in present form / without additional qualifications (just supporting open source doesn't go far enough toward a sustainable model for me). Joren's our IP expert, maybe he can take on this proposal? - kate

Patents also have their useful aspects. I would suggest to work on societal taxes and dividends for redistribution, this way the gains the corps had through public research flows back to the citizen. See also 'European New Deal'. - lynx

I wouldn't want DiEM25 to make such a statement as it would accept and acknowledge that citizen and consumers become more transparent while that isn't actually necessary for anything, it has no societal benefit and should be forbidden by law. Still, even if we defend the privacy of people it is still important for humanity to improve transparency of corporations (other pillar however). - lynx

In my opinion this is only radical prose and not politically clever – We should concentrate on different business models or public funded solutions - subliminal guy

Outlawing advertising is a worthwhile thought. It is rarely ever used to inform us of the existence of some new product and most of the time manipulating us, especially everyone below 20 years of age or so (when advertising actually works best — check research on the subject). This is beyond the scope of our pillar, but we could certainly forbid all kinds of surveillance-based and individualised advertisement built on psychological manipulation by disabling certain features of HTTP and Javascript *by law*. No web browser is allowed to support them. No web server in Europe must try to employ them. - lynx

I was mostly referring to sentences like ""People wanting more and not being happy with what they have."" Such a statement belongs to blunted discussions in the park while drinking Carlsberg and Beck's and wearing nike sneakers and H&M shorts combined with a ""insert-your-favorite-hipster-brand""-shirt

Sustainable in what sense? - subliminal guy

Off-topic? - lynx

Probably true, but do we have scientific material on the subject? And does it belong to this pillar? - lynx

Patchworky proposal. Is there any scientific sociologic backing to doing things this way? Liquid democracy at least has http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07723 speaking for it. Also, representation doesn't work. - lynx

EC might indeed take care of that, but it is only a secondary problem. The main problem is how the advertising and online markets were allowed to converge onto just 5 gatekeeper companies (plus 2 in China). - lynx

We could require that all smartphone apps must also be usable from any computer. Technically this is already possible, but hardly anyone has an Android emulator on their laptop. - lynx

This seems to be asking for an exchange standard, not a legislation. Standard document formats however exist, also means for upload — so if the industry hasn't established a standard practice in this field maybe that's because they have no economic incentive to do so? A legal policy could make it mandatory for publishing platforms to accept a uniform simple document upload format. Not clear to me which political problem this really addresses. - lynx

If we let humanity live on in the mine field of an unregulated Internet, then we need to spend billions in educating the teachers so that they actually know what they are talking about. Probably easier to change the Internet so that it no longer is a mine field. Then *nobody* has to learn encryption tools, and *nobody* has to understand why they are necessary. The ""alternative"" would become the default as mandated by legislation (#ObCrypto). - lynx

This is not an accurate description on how the big 5 became monopolies. - lynx

Free/Open Source software was one of the winning ingredients of Google and subsequent monopolists. When it came to making a product they moved the code to the private realm, just like it is described with research above. FLOSS alone is not the solution, it needs supporting legislation. - lynx

DiEM is not in government, therefore it should not confuse electorate with ""preliminary"" steps. It should promote the long-term vision for fair technology that doesn't suck. Proprietary technology should not be legal for any societally critical applications. - lynx

Copyright abolition would not solve this problem. Content goes viral using one specific URL and whoever has that copy makes all the money. Still, the idea of going back to ""broadcast"" is very good and the way to achieve could be to (a) make it mandatory to distribute websites by multicast pubsub instead of HTTP (see https://secushare.org/pubsub or IPFS for that), (b) make targeted advertising illegal and (c) introduce a mandatory anonymous micropayment system by which *any* article can be bought anonymously for a few cents. See https://taler.net for the most promising payment system in that regard. - lynx

Yes, and forbid proprietary code in all societally essential systems, therefore giving any programmer on Earth a decent chance to find vulnerabilities by reading *source code* rather than disassembling machine code. - lynx

Oh yeah! We need funding to *create* a truly distributed and private social network. None of the existing softwares can actually replace Facebook *technically*. In most cases they are just yet another server you have to trust. See https://secushare.org - lynx

Why? And is it enough if it is just a right and not an obligation? For the defense of democracy it probably must be mandatory to anonymise or at least pseudonymise digital activity. - lynx

This can actually be solved technically and should be mandated by law. See https://youbroketheinternet.org/programme for details. - lynx

Spare a few details that are too detailed you just pretty accurately described the GNUnet/secushare project.  <3  The YBTI proposals for legislation aim at obtaining this kind of Internet instead of the current borken one. Instead of asking money to be spent in making this system we recommend to make it a necessary requirement so that the entire industry MUST work on solving this challenge: the challenge for an ethically acceptable Internet. - lynx

Breaking up the monopolists would need to be repeated yearly as the digital market tends to recreate new monopolists. The best way to prevent trading of data is to not let anyone *have* any data to trade — otherwise trade will happen, either legally or in the darknet, simply because the data is there and there is no evidence of it being abused or stolen. - lynx

Yes, but how? - lynx

This assumes GDPR actually achieves the goal. See https://youbroketheinternet.org/GDPR for a criticism why GDPR may in large part fail to actually achieve the intended goals. - lynx

Yes I already boiled it down in the actual green paper draft ... Glad you like it, tho ... Most of it comes from Maidsafe's specs. I only added the EU as facilitator ...

What do you think about using the Laravel service container for things like this? Since we're now namespaced we no longer need the `PKP` suffixes on classes (except for backwards compatibility). We can let the app configure the service container with the appropriate classname when we need to specify it, and have pkp-lib just specify `ContributorForm`. Particularly when there are empty subclasses, I find myself wishing for a better way...

I would rather `is_inactive` be specifiable as a parameter (even if the default is to exclude inactive sections). If I were coding without checking, I would expect `getByContextId` to get *everything*; if that's not the case, autocomplete/hinting should guide the dev to know what to expect.

(BTW, I just merged https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/8366 to `main` in OMP and pkp/browse; a doubled check won't cause harm, but just FYI.)

Did this accidentally invert the test? I think this is expecting to only index completed submissions.

Just philosophically, can we use LibreOffice files?

One submission test to exercise the UI, the rest to go via the API. :+1: :+1: :+1: :+1: 

Since https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/7673, it should no longer be necessary (or desirable!) to specify a list of locales for these.

Very happy to be decreasing our stable of these.

Missing `|escape` (also for `{translate}` call below) -- this one isn't critical, and probably not the one below either, but a good habit and just in case.

Oh no. I see it uses `submissionMetadataFormTitleFields.tpl` and `submissionMetadataFormFields.tpl` too. As well as the `AuthorGridHandler`. All of this has been removed. I see two options: 1) move these files into QuickSubmit (but I have probably removed several locale strings that they use) or 2) rewrite QuickSubmit to use the new wizard as a base. Both seem like a lot of work.

The thing I don't like about using `app(ContributorForm::class)` or `App::make(ContributorForm::class)` is that the return is not type hinted. So it has to be manually annotated:

```php
/** @var ContributorForm $form */
$form = app(ContributorForm::class);
```

The other problem is that if dependencies can't be automatically injected -- and they usually can't be for forms -- then we have to read the code to know what to pass to the service container, rather than having the editor tell us what the constructor expects:

```php
$form = app(ContributorForm::class, [
    'action' => $url,
    'locales' => $locales,
    'submission' => $submission,
    'context' => $context,
]);
```

This becomes especially problematic if the constructors differ between apps. And using different constructor function signatures is a common way to extend a base class in an app.

I think the service container is only good for when we want to do automatic dependency injection. For example, injecting the request, file service, schema service or other singletons into a `Handler.

> I find myself wishing for a better way...

Increasingly, I find that I am writing a helper function in a `PageHandler` that gets a form class, because this can be clearly type-hinted and easily overridden in an app:

```php
namespace PKP\pages;

use PKP\components\SectionForm;

class SectionHandler extends Handler
{
    protected function getSectionForm(Context $context): SectionForm
    {
        return new SectionForm($context);
    }
}
```

```php
namespace APP\pages\section;

use APP\components\SectionForm;

class SectionHandler extends PKP\pages\SectionHandler
{
    protected function getSectionForm(Context $context): SectionForm
    {
        return new SectionForm($context);
    }
}
```

That's a lot of boilerplate. But the base `Handler` is fully decoupled from `APP\components\SectionForm` and everything is nicely type-hinted. If the base `Handler` needs a function that's dramatically different between apps, then `PKP\components\SectionForm` can add an abstract function for it.

In this case, `is_inactive` is a condition of `$submittableOnly`. This was added when inactive sections were added. So historically, `$submittableOnly` meant ""can a non-editor submit to this section"". 

If I were to add `?boolean $isInactive = false` as a function argument, then it would be possible to call the function in a way that undermines this logic, since even editors can not submit to inactive sections:

```php
$submittableOnly = true;
$isInactive = true;
$sections = $sectionDao->getByContextId($contextId, null, $submittableOnly, $isInactive);
```

We could fix this by changing `$submittableOnly` to `$restrictedToEditors`. But that would be changing the _intent_ of the original function argument.

Oh good catch! Had to update a bunch of these when going from `int` to `string`.

Although now that I'm looking at it, is this code correct? Should the article search index be checking if the submission is published? Or does this work in both ways (ie - it removes indexing for articles after they have been unpublished)?

As a counterpoint: shouldn't we be testing with the file formats most commonly used by our community? It probably makes sense for us to have a whole bunch of file formats for the tests, so I could add LibreOffice versions in addition to these.

Just a preference and an area where I don't mind us staking out a position. But not worth a debate -- carry on as you like.

Or 3. Leave it in OJS/pkp-lib for now but mark it deprecated.

This is for the command-line tool, which clears the index entirely and then re-generates it from scratch. The check here is to avoid indexing content that is not completely submitted yet.

Ah, NVM, I missed this already being in a conditional covered by the calling parameters. :+1: 

Less boilerplate than a pointless empty subclass. I think this is a good approach.

:+1: I've added `.odt` and `.ods` files to the tests. My original plan was to use these to test the document type icons in the UI. But having these formats will be good for us to write mimetype tests, which might break unexpectedly with dependency updates.

Ok, I've restored the files related to QuickSubmit, but I'm slightly doubting the wisdom of this. Still, maybe pain later is better than pain now. I am probably vastly underestimating the work level, but it might not be terribly difficult to add the extra QuickSubmit fields on top of the new wizard, which would head off any future problems. I know Erik has QuickSubmit on his todo list for PS.

I've only restored the code for OJS. As far as I could tell, the QuickSubmit plugin doesn't support OMP or OPS. Is that right?

Some things to consider:

- There's a good chance that changes to the data models will not be reflected in the quick submit forms, and so we're likely to get divergence in the data structure. None of the validation layers built into the API are applied in QuickSubmit.
- I had to restore the author grid, which means I had to restore the old author forms. In addition to the data consistency problem, it means that a plugin like ROR will have to integrate with both sets of author forms for 3.4.
- Any third-party plugin developer who integrated with the old submission wizard or author forms will probably be confused when they go to update their plugins. The plugins won't effect the submission wizard, but all the hooks that they used before are still there to be grep'd in the code base. 

I isolated these changes in single commits in case we still want to reverse course. It required 5,000+ lines of code to be restored (many of them locale keys). You can see the restored code here:

- https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/pull/8349/commits/f21630e4df695c6d2702389d719b1859b52c3c78  
- https://github.com/pkp/ojs/pull/3579/commits/db25b70d913da783d69c08d2d7f0860fa5594464

I'm currently unable to do any tests, because (I think) the main branch is broken.

Finally, to restore the locale keys, I wrote a little script that would copy a locale key in all locales from another instance of OJS (in this case, the `main` branch). It worked like:

```
php lib/pkp/tools/restoreLocaleKeys.php ""submission.submit.selectPrincipalContact"" ~/pkp/ojs-main
```

Do you want me to add this tool to `main`? Not sure if this is something that's done often enough to bother.

Oh, and just for record keeping in case we need it: here are all of the locale keys that I restored after restoring these forms:

- submission.submit.form.authorRequired
- submission.submit.form.titleRequired
- submission.submit.form.abstractRequired
- submission.submit.form.languagesRequired
- submission.submit.form.subjectsRequired
- submission.submit.form.disciplinesRequired

- author.users.contributor.includeInBrowse
- notification.addedAuthor
- notification.editedAuthor
- grid.action.editContributor
- submission.submit.form.contributorRoleRequired
- submission.submit.selectPrincipalContact

I think this is intentional, and probably a good thing, but just noting: this will now list users who were previously only auto-assigned, which might cause confusion for existing users who are used to the list *only* showing section editors. Strictly up to you, but if you think it's worth tweaking, it might be good to group the listed users by user group, e.g.:
> Editors: Barnes
> Section Editors: Buskins, Berardo

I think this is a great improvement over what the spec allows today. However, one slight shortcoming is that clients would still need multiple calls if they wanted to update rules of different `kind`s. I wonder if that's a use case we should seek to support? E.g. I suppose we could move the `kind` parameter into the body of the request?

Along the same train of thought, this proposal also doesn't allow changing `actions` and `enabled` simultaneously. In both cases the client would be left with the multi-failure mode we're trying to fix. This almost makes me wonder if we'd need a `PUT /_matrix/client/v1/pushrules_bulk`?

I'm somewhat concerned about giving clients too much ability to cause performance issues on the server-side with large bulk endpoints (each push rules change triggers a sync loop poke). In theory, the client can isolate the `actions` and `enabled` calls safely, and encouraging them to do so would be a good thing imo.

Supporting bulk changes across different kinds is an interesting question though: it implies that one or more push rules might be at the wrong level and need redefining or reconsidering. I'm very interested in this sort of usecase :)

> I'm somewhat concerned about giving clients too much ability to cause performance issues on the server-side with large bulk endpoints (each push rules change triggers a sync loop poke). 

Good point, yes. Could the `/sync` triggers be batched up on the server-side so that you only trigger a single time for any bulk request?
 
> the client can isolate the actions and enabled calls safely, and encouraging them to do so would be a good thing imo

The Element iOS app uses an interesting logic here. When you toggle any of the global notification settings on or off, it issues two `PUT`s. One to `/enable` to ensure that the rule is actually on and one to `/actions` to toggle between `notify` and `dont_notify`. I'm not sure if other clients behave similarly but in this case there are two requests tied to a single UI control so isolating them would probably be tricky?

> Supporting bulk changes across different kinds is an interesting question though: it implies that one or more push rules might be at the wrong level and need redefining or reconsidering. I'm very interested in this sort of usecase :)

Yeah, when thinking through it again, I'm actually failing to come up with a reasonable example. You're probably right that this should normally be taken care of by the priority hierarchy of the different rule kinds.

It would only be a single sync trigger, but that's still a large trigger to happen: we're actively avoiding APIs that allow for arbitrarily large requests/responses, and an endpoint which is ""too bulk"" would ultimately cause excess data to be transmitted. 

As for Element iOS: this sounds like a bug in the client. The client should have a cached copy of the push rules to be able to make decisions on, and the UI control would still be able to represent a failed state: setting actions on a disabled rule prepares it for when it can be enabled, meaning the client can use the enabled/disabled state to determine if something went wrong. A suggested approach would be to set the actions first (where if it fails the client has no-oped the user's request), then enable the rules. If the enable step fails, the UI control can show that easily, allowing the user to try again. With caching, the client can also determine if it needs to change the actions/enabled state of each individual rule it plans to affect.

> It would only be a single sync trigger, but that's still a large trigger to happen: we're actively avoiding APIs that allow for arbitrarily large requests/responses, and an endpoint which is ""too bulk"" would ultimately cause excess data to be transmitted.

Ah, got it. That makes sense. 👍

> setting actions on a disabled rule prepares it for when it can be enabled, meaning the client can use the enabled/disabled state to determine if something went wrong

That's a great point! @alfogrillo we should make sure that the `PUT`s are issued this way around on Element iOS.

I can confirm that:
- **Element Desktop**: runs `actions`, then `enabled` on completion
- **Element iOS**: runs `actions` and `enabled` **concurrently** 😅

Also, the GoogleDrive extractor has a similar list.

Your state Event is fine though. 

Having the PL as the state key seems weird to me. I would have expected the mxid. 🤔 As I would want to lookup the tag for the user so I would go by user id since I might not know the powerlevel. 

I think this may not work as there are clients with more than just those 2 options. So it may not always work. What is speaking against letting the displaying client decide the color? 

Roles instead of powerlevels would be imho a note worthy alternative even though there is no msc for it that I am aware of. 

Does this replace `m.room.power_levels`? Or does it add another layer to it? If it adds a layer why not add it within that state Event? 

Who is allowed to set these? I assume only PL>50?

Does an event without associated PL grant the permission? How would it get mapped to those without the powerlevel? The current powerlevel event allows setting specific numbers to specific actions. This doesn't seem to have something like this. 

I think its more of a suggestion. Discord has Roles with Colours and on there a colour is fine on dark theme and bad on light but this fixes that problem kinda but matrix also has infinite UI variants so that problem is more complicated on matrix. 

This is as close as you get to roles without going for RBAC or hacking in full roles that dont matter auth wise. If you ask me. So its an alternative that should be mentioned but still. 

This is clearly a PL Labels MSC and therefore drop in backwards compatible with all room versions and all existing homeserver implementations and clients that follow the spec due to that it will be ignored safely by non implementing stakeholders. 

I don't think this is intended to be a full  event?  It looks like this is just the definition for the `content` of an event.

Not the author but i mean unless this MSC gives a recomendation to change the PL template your client uses this would be arbitrary state PL ofc. 

As addressed earlier. This is clearly a PL tags MSC and therefore makes no authorisation related changes. It only makes it so you can define that users at the PL of 1337 are Elite Haxors or whatever name you want to give to a given powerlevel. This proposal does implicit ranges. I personally would have if this wasnt made written a MSC that does Explicit ranges only. But as mentioned in another comment i dont want to compete with this MSC with my MSC that has diffrences due to the lack of improvements that are worth competing over when they are of potentially dubious value compared to this approach.

I think the idea is that this just gives names to the numerical power levels, rather than trying to introduce a new permissions system.  So, say I have PL100 in a room via the normal power levels mechanism.  Then the client can look up the appropriate `m.room.power_level_tag` and find out that in that room, with PL100, I am to be referred to as ""The Absolute Ruler"".

Rather than using one state event per state key, you could put all the labels in a single event, with a map from PL to label.  e.g.

``` jsonc
{
  ""type"": ""m.room.power_level_tags"",
  ""state_key"": """",
  ""content"": {
    ""100"": {
      ""name"": ""Admin"",
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

Please wrap your lines to ~80-120 characters

Ah yeah it just seemed weird as the state event is in full

My only concern is event size overflow. Maybe we should restrict the name value to like 50 character?

Most of the client use white and black backgrounds so both these properties make sense to maintain good color contrast for most usecases.

I agree its very common for clients to have darker themes and ligher themes. So offering a way to accomodate this i think is a good idea. 

My concern is just that dark and light is a spectrum not a constant. You can have dark and light and yet have different bg colors in clients. And with that you end up running into accessibility issues where the contrast might not be enough. (see accessibility spec for html/css World which needs a surprising large amount of contrast. So it is easy to mot have enough.) 

I personally think that we cant do too much to mittigate accessibility issues caused by user definable colours. I think that the obvious fix accessibility wise is an accessibility option that disables this customisation venue. 

Possibly.  I'm not suggesting that the alternative that I gave is better (or worse) than what you suggested, but it should probably be listed as an alternative, so that the pros and cons can be discussed.  The reason I suggested that alternative is because it is more similar to how some other state events work (notably the power levels event itself), so it seems to be an obvious way to do things.  Though of course, obvious doesn't mean better.

Alternatively we can only use a `hue` (0 - 360) property to supply a base color and let the client decide how much saturation and brightness they want to add so it stay accessible in their design system. But this will limit the color choices.

How about providing translated names? Right now clients like Element translate the names into the user locale, so making this a map would be interesting. For example

```json
{
  ""name"": {
    ""en"": ""Guest"",
    ""de"": ""Gast""
  }
  ...
}
```

The key would be an ISO locale code. If the requested locale is missing, we would need some kind of fallback to other locales, in the end falling back to `""en""`.

It looks like this is going to be user input so translation does not make sense here. A community can label users with certain power level anything.

Well multilingual communities should be supported since they might bring translations for all langauges they use. For example a community for the Swedish Speakers in finland might bring a Swedish, Finish and English translation for their roles. And in more corporate usecases this will also be able to be utilised properly.

In our case it is a cooperate use case, where multi-language role names are important. Right now it is solved by forking clients and replacing the translations with custom ones.

There is an RBAC MSC in #2812 that could be an alternative, but I think that implementing this MSC is a lot smaller than replacing the power levels with an RBAC system.

@FSG-Cat How do you propose managing these translations? Since this is user input, and only some users can edit state events then only those will be able to translate them. Plus this makes the UX of roles in a client very complex and on top of that since power levels are room-specific, translating those in each room will be an extra burden. 

IMO, if a community wants to add a multi-lingual role for say administrator with PL 100, they can create a Tag with name administrateur and PL99 and add those accordingly to users.

> Plus this makes the UX of roles in a client very complex

UX wise, you probably can default to a single language mode and allow multi-language flows for advanced users. Most people probably only require a single language.

@kfiven I fail to see how the UX would be too complicated because of this. But lets put that besides for now. The translations would be community managed because its a Bring your own Translations system. Also on the note that its room specific yes and no. Its room specific but you can template this and like tbh PL sync is going to be a thing at this rate. I have personally thought about writing the MSC for it.

Also as for your using diffrent PL fix i say that is a wholy unacceptable compromise compared to the slightly more complicated UX or requirement to use specialised tooling like the Feline Matrix Assistant that i made or Matrix Wrench etc. Like its not a compromise that gets you this specific feature at all. You get forced to give admins a rank list as in who can demote who and also you also make it so their tag name is only accurate in a single language per admin meaning you cant know what their role is supposed to be in your language even if said community can translate into it unless said language is the language used for that admins tag. 

Also just to clarify on the nature of these translations. They are not translations where you try to cover all languages on earth. They are translations where you cover the languages used in your community. Therefore it does not matter that its limited scope as to who can write.

I mean how will the client developers know which community wants which language in their PL translation, so clients have to suggest ISO codes of all languages. If we left it empty then it's up to the user to find out those, which again is bad UX for not-so-technical users.

On top of those, this introduces a parallel translation option to the one client uses to translate its interface, which is again bad UX for translators.

Lastly, I feel translating a state event is fundamentally wrong because with this logic a room name also could be another candidate for such translation, and room topic too.

Could we partially solve this by defining default tags that we can then refer to by for example instead of using `""name"" : ""Moderator""`, we use `""default_name"" : ""Moderator""` to instruct the client to localize? A selection of maybe 5 different tags will be plenty for most use cases and only the remainder would have to deal with translating the tags themselves.

1. Technically you can have a ceph conf with a global section not first I believe. Something like
```
[mon]
k = v

[global]
k2 = v2
```
That wouldn't work if set as the extra ceph conf with this patch as the `k2 = v2` setting would end up in the [mon] section.

2.  I think it's possible in the future that the minimal ceph conf could include sections that aren't [global]
3. If there is an issue here we are fixing we'd ideally have some test cases specified so that we know what works.
4. Currently make check is failing on this PR as this change caused one of the unit tests to fail

I created a quick sample commit that tries to formalize the combining of the minimal ceph conf and the extra ceph conf that handles the points above to generally show what I mean (ignore all the logging 
 at error level. That was just for testing) https://github.com/adk3798/ceph/commit/b905bab6e94568d33a83c9c54c95500102dc1e03. Thoughts?

Thanks for your quick response. I only considered case which current minimal conf is. Yes it will cause issues according to your sample. And I think you have pointed out the reason why make check failed( '\n\n'). Should I fix it or you'd like to do it? Cuz I saw the code and it has already completed most works.

If you can, you can do it. I haven't cleaned it up and you can maybe make sure it works with whatever caused you to hit the issue in the first place.

Thanks so much. It works fine in my cases, please review again.

forgot to check make check failure before leaving my initial review. @Svelar it seems the code here is working very slightly differently than mine and causing the unit test to fail.

I tested locally and it passes if you just add a blank line at the end of each section in the expected conf string in the test (and that blank line should be fine in the conf, so we should be okay just updating the test)

  Thanks for pointing out, I also forgot that. I have modified the code, and then passed all checks.

Do we really have to build our own config parser for this? I guess we have to, right? But is this the right place to start building a config parser in Python for ceph? 

Actually for now, minimal conf can't be created by user, so config parser is simply. The main purpose is to mix two confs. Any suggest?

probably once we start refactoring cephadm (in reef by using the new packaged version) we can add/reuse support to parse conf and use it to perform this merging moving this code outside of cephadm.

Addressing your first comment, that was mostly just that I forgot you can `yield` None like that, so I added a 'simple' value. Fixed that up.

For comment 2, I went ahead and added a docstring but I'm not sure what level of detail is appropriate (or if I did the `py:meth` annotations correctly). Let me know if the language needs tweaking.

Finally on comment 3, I'm having issues actually running the tests - I've tried on both Windows with Docker for Desktop and on Linux, and while the issue is different I can't seem to get the tests to actually run on either system. I _think_ I've added a test, but I'm not actually familiar with the testing framework being used.

The HTTP verbs for gRPC is restricted to POST as described in [gRPC specification](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md#L25).

https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md#L25

The `grpc_method` is more like the name of the Function.

Here is comparison of gRPC  with HTTP API:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/comparison?view=aspnetcore-3.1

It's already included in the latest test_server_interceptor file.

Agreed, will change that.

Sorry, it was a long day. Yes, same apiType in request and sync methods. I will remove the default in the other clause and switch positions here.

Mollie API / Klarna is very strict on the phone number format. I'm not sure if an automatic transformation is a good idea when it comes to the payment process. So I removed the phone numbers altogether, Klarna will ask for them at a later stage if necessary.

Addiontally, GDPR makes it difficult to pass this information, IMHO.

From the GDPR point of view, the shipping address and the e-mail should be removed as well

Right, but they are necessary for the Orders API. Phone number is not. So I think a shop provider could argue with Article 6 here.

Not a good candidate for other non-moderation cases through.

We would like to hide locked users from the user directory, should it be added to this MSC or left as an implementation detail ?

If left as an implementation detail I am thinking of providing an option in synapse to tweak the behavior.

Yeah, if I remember correctly the initial reason that triggered this work was trying to make Synapse's [account validity](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/account_validity_callbacks.html) feature not use an [out-of-spec error code](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/07d7cbfe69c239a7ffe5668c1166799370eef0d6/synapse/api/errors.py#L73).

A use case could be that an organisation might require its members to verify their activity within the org by clicking a link sent via email every few months. In which case it is desirable to visibly lock the user out of their account if they don't click the link before a set grace period ends, but it isn't to deactivate their account because they might e.g. be on holiday and should be able to recover it by clicking on said link when they come back.

I won't update the MSC with this clarification (since I'm abandoning it, see https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3939#issuecomment-1618816306), but if you think that would be helpful to add it in (which I would tend to agree with) feel free!

My personal opinion is that this sounds like an implementation detail to me.

We need to think carefully about doing this, since it would break all external links to the existing communities page.

This could be combined with the existing `resources :users` statement, so that `resources :users` isn't defined twice

I don't think the hundreds of repeated `# arrange`, `# act`, `# assert` comments are helpful - they are just more text to read and maintain (e.g. when refactoring tests).

I suggest removing the `# arrange` comments entirely, and changing the other two to blank lines. For example:

```ruby
  def test_edit_get_no_session
    c = create(:community)

    get edit_community_path(c)

    assert_response :redirect
    assert_redirected_to login_path(:referer => edit_community_path(c))
  end
```
This keeps the readability of having the three sections being distinct from one another, but with less clutter.

From previous review, ""site"" here is not clear. Perhaps one of: name, label, text. 

(You previously suggested ""link"" but I think that's even more confusing with ""link"" vs ""url""!)

I thought the model had attributes of ""latitude"", not ""lat""? Same for lon.

Isn't ""Create %{model_name}"" the default here?

just `longitude` since there's no other longitude in this function

note to self: should it?

A more compact version, using sort:

`lat1, lat2 = [Random.rand(-90.0..90.0), Random.rand(-90.0..90.0)].sort`

To avoid duplicating the random number bit, you can use an Array construction with a block, but it's perhaps less readable? Probably a personal preference between these two.

`lat1, lat2 = Array.new(2) { Random.rand(-90.0..90.0) }.sort`

Is this necessary to count this here?

Could we bundle this in the previous test instead of having two separate ones with the same setup? I know we typically want to keep each test focused, but since we're testing scenarios (there's an initial query, there's a query and then the detached panel is closed) I think it would be more readable.

Same as above, I would bundle these assertions in your first test, with comments to explain what they're about. wdyt?

```suggestion

        container.querySelector('.aa-DetachedSearchButtonQuery')

I took this line from an other test, I guess we can remove it 👍 

I merged the tests to keep only 2 scenarios:

### First scenario

- click on the detached search button
- focus the input and type a query `a`
- close the modal by clicking on the cancel button
- assert that the `query` is still present in the last call of `onStateChange`
- assert that the detached search button still has the query
- assert that the placeholder is hidden

### Second scenario

- initial state with a query `a`
- assert that the detached search button has the query
- assert that the placeholder is hidden

Should we assert `onStateChange` in the second scenario too?

I think it's fine, what matters is the end-user experience.

How would this work with custom serialization? For example the immutable case, would `transit.toJSON` be used directly, or should somehow the actual `ImmutableSharedState` serializer be used? What does this look like when multiple serializers are used (w/ aliasing like you have in the example below)

In this example, wouldn't it be better to just use the standard JSON serializer/deserializer (by using the the serialized `immutable-transit` strings as values) rather than a custom out-of-band serialization/deserialization?

I can't think of anything that would need for *true* custom serialization/deserialization aside from CSS-in-JS implementations.

Nice idea! I think generally it's good if we move things that do side effects into the DI system (for testing as you mention). Hopefully this would make it easier for more plugins to be totally pure.

That said, for testing, I think long-term, hopefully we can make the puppeteer-style testing story easier so not as much needs to be mocked.

I think we need a string, especially to make the mocking experience good

This doesn't actually change the serialization, only the deserialization. So whether it is custom or default, this will return whatever the value is in the map. You could put an immutable-js object here directly

I don't really understand what you mean here. Could you elaborate, maybe with an example?

Yea, a separate issue from this is having puppeteer style tests with access to `app`, but still I think this is useful even when we have support for that.

What do you do with the resulting data in this case?

How do you make it available to other parts of the app? (either redux state or react context)

What types of shared data are we expecting to support? Should you expect to serialize your entire redux state tree? Should you use it for storing preferences? Or how agnostic should it be to your data type?

Why are you writing to and reading from HTML directly? I'd rather have the framework abstract this away for me.

I understand you want an escape hatch, but I think the default case should be that the framework sets the return value of this function in the DOM, and then on the browser is responsible for trying to find that element and passing its results as an argument to deserialize.

I agree with this solution instead of overloading ctx further

I think it would be worth adding a strawman example of what the testing experience would look like using tokens instead of string ids to the alternatives section. I agree mocking will probably be easier with strings than working with tokens, but maybe it's possible to have a token-based API that's still pretty good?

I'd feel sad adding string ids as part of this API especially considering how much effort/time was put into making a DI system that didn't rely on them.

That would still be done via react context

By default this will just support JSON serializable data, but since the serializer/deserializer is in the DI system, you can basically add support for any data type you want.

By default the framework handles writing to html / dom. It is only in the case where you want custom serialization / deserialization when you need to do this manually. 

The reason I think we need the escape hatch to include html/dom APIs is it could be dependent on your serialization mechanism. For example, you might want to serialize it into an inline js script rather than a json script tag.

We could have the id be configured via a token, I just feel like it is kinda overkill. The plugin can export a UUID if you really want it to be guaranteed unique. FWIW, we are using string ids today.

Here is an example of what it would look like configuring the string as a token:

```js
const MyPluginSharedStateIDToken = createToken('MyPluginSharedState');
createPlugin({
  deps: {
    SharedState: SharedStateToken,
    SharedStateID: MyPluginSharedStateIDToken
  },
  middleware({SharedState, SharedStateID}) {
     const {serialize, deserialize} = SharedState(SharedStateID);
  }
});

// ... in main.js
app.register(MyPluginSharedStateIDToken, 'some-id');
app.register(SharedStateToken, MockSharedState({
  'some-id': mockdata
});
```

This works, but honestly I think it is too much boilerplate as the number of apps which need serialization grows. I would prefer a pattern where the plugin exports the serialization id.

```js
// In fusion-plugin-redux-react
export const SerializationID = '@fusion-plugin-redux-react/serialization-id'

// In test code
import {SerializationID} from 'fusion-plugin-redux-react';
app.register(SharedStateToken, MockSharedState({
  [SerializationID]: mockdata
});
```



I think the actual HTML part of the serialization and standardization can be entirely kept in core and not exposed. Custom deserializers/serializers need not involve HTML at all, just `A → string` and `string → A` functions, and the core SSR plugin itself can handle the HTML part.

So you'd have something sort of like this.

```js
const DefaultSharedState = {
  serialize: data => JSON.stringify(data),
  deserialize: serializedData => JSON.parse(serializedData)
};

const ImmutableSharedState = {
  serialize: data => transit.toJSON(data),
  deserialize: serializedData => transit.fromJSON(serializedData)
};
```

I don't see the need for serialization/deserialization code to be actually concerned with modifying the HTML and/or querying the HTML. The only special case is CSS-in-JS, and in that case, they will want to implement that in a totally custom way rather than using this.

That is true if we limit what you can do with the serialization / deserialization. For example, this would not be possible if we wanted that type of API:

```js
const WindowSharedState = (id) => {
  return {
    serialize: (ctx, data) => {
      ctx.template.head.push(
        html`<script nonce=${ctx.nonce}'>window.SOME_DATA=${JSON.stringify(data)}</div>`
      );
    },
    deserialize: () => {
      return window.SOME_DATA
    }
  }
}
```

As long as we are okay with limiting the types of serialization/deserialization to `<script type='application/json>` then I am okay with this. I'm just not quite sure if this limitation will be a problem for us.

I think it's doubtful that constraint will be an issue in practice. The only non-contrived use case I've been able to come up thus far is CSS-in-JS, but it's unclear to me how mocking state would make sense in that case.

ok - I can update the RFC to reflect that API

I'm referencing the fact that `data` is assigned to a variable but then nothing is done with it. Can you add examples for redux (I know you have one later down) and React context?

String IDs just feel off to me when we have tokens. Tokens feel like the right tool to me here to avoid naming collisions. Are we not concerned about possible naming collisions at all?

Here's one example of an API I was playing with, still on the fence, but it's using tokens, thoughts?
```js
// ... in main.js
app.enhance(SharedStateToken, SharedState => SharedState(MyPluginSharedStateToken, shareddata));

// In test code
app.enhance(SharedStateToken, SharedState => SharedState(MyPluginSharedStateToken, mockdata));

// In plugin:
const {serialize, deserialize} = SharedState.extract(MyPluginSharedStateToken);
```


Potentially what might be simpler is all values are always `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse`, and if you want something else you can just serialize/deserialize into a string, which is valid JSON. Although I suppose this might be more overhead.

I think it is pretty safe to use strings for this type of thing, especially since we are doing it today already with no problem. The string could be prefixed with the name of the npm package for example.

Would this be `deserialize(serialize(mockValue))` or just `mockValue`?

I think a couple aspects of this particular explanation aren't totally clear to me
- What's the difference between setting the shared state, setting the default shared state, and mocking the shared state, and overriding the shared state? Is this API only used for testing? What happens when it's used normally? I think hopefully we could avoid using ""mock"" as part of the API if it's not necessarily testing-specific.
- Does this change which ""deserialize"" function is called, or merely change the values on which deserialize operates on? Part of this explanation seems to imply that `deserialize` is mocked, but the name of the actual function makes it seem like only the itself data is being changed.

Is this solution that bad (i.e. just having a token for each plugin)? I guess it depends on a few factors
- How frequently you want to mock the ""universal"" states for multiple separate plugins
- How much boilerplate/docs is required

However, I think there are some potential advantages of per-plugin state mock/override tokens:
- Better type safety? I'm not totally sure but it seems like this might be difficult to type
- No need for string IDs (no typos)
- Plugins can't have *implicit* dependencies on other plugin's shared state (using string ids)

```js
import {FooStateToken} from ""fusion-plugin-foo"";
import {BarStateToken} from ""fusion-plugin-bar"";
import {BazStateToken} from ""fusion-plugin-baz"";

// in tests
app.register(FooStateToken, /* something */);
app.register(BarStateToken, /* something */);
app.register(BazStateToken, /* something */);
```

I suppose this is more verbose, but could be remedied:

```js
import {FooStateToken} from ""fusion-plugin-foo"";
import {BarStateToken} from ""fusion-plugin-bar"";
import {BazStateToken} from ""fusion-plugin-baz"";

function mockState(app, state) {
  app.register(FooStateToken, state.foo);
  app.register(BarStateToken, state.bar);
  app.register(BazStateToken, state.baz);
}

// in tests
mockState(app, {foo, bar, baz});
```

just the mockValue

Yea open for suggestions on the naming here. I actually originally put the `MockSharedState` (or w/e we call it) into `fusion-test-utils` because it really should only be used for testing. It is really just a helper for mocking `deserialize`. Maybe it could mock `serialize` also, but I think that will be less useful. But that comment I think describes it pretty well:

> Deserialize calls will now return the mock values for these ids

It does just that.

I don't think what you are proposing is correct or possible. Maybe you are missing some context from the RFC. The user doesn't provide the data, the plugin provides the data. So the data itself cannot come from the token. Maybe we should have a quick chat IRL to go over the doc

```suggestion
```

Unfortunately it does not. There seems so be some process.nextTick() shenanigans which means that with just:
```
await client.end()
await client.end()
```
The 2nd end() is actually resolved as a result of events emitted from the first end() and the test will succeed without code changes. Adding the sleep() call makes the test actually fail before the code change, and then pass with the code change. If that still doesn't make sense then I can try to point to the source with more  detail.

Please do. It looks to me like `end` would either have to be emitted twice on the connection for that to happen (bad), or the connection’s `_connecting` would have to transition back to `false`.

To further clarify: the ""end"" event which resolves the `client.end()` promise/callback is emitted when `client.connection.stream` [emits ""end"" itself](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/blob/21ccd4f1b6e66774bbf24aecfccdbfe7c9b49238/packages/pg/lib/connection.js#L107) i.e. the readable side of the socket is closed, and again when the [stream emits ""close""](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/blob/21ccd4f1b6e66774bbf24aecfccdbfe7c9b49238/packages/pg/lib/connection.js#L57). The close event may not be emitted on the same tick, and could be several ticks later, basically whenever the socket is fully and finally closed.

So I could actually write this test with 3 `end()`s rather than a `sleep()`
```javascript
await client.end()
// connection.end()
//   stream.end()
// ...
// stream emits ""end""
//    connection emits ""end""
//       promise resolved
await client.end()
// connection.end()
//   stream.end() but this is already closing and does nothing
// ...
// stream emits ""close""; no more events will be emitted from the stream
//   connection emits ""end""
//     promise resolved
await client.end() // <-- this will wait forever
```

Yeah, connection emitting `end` twice doesn’t seem good. Not sure if it’s intended.

Right, I was initially expecting the first `client.end()` to resolve only when the underlying socket is fully closed i.e. `stream.on('close')`. At this point I'm wondering if that's something I should try to change as well. Reason being: resolving before the client is really dead is technically incorrect.

Is this the best place to do this? 

Can we perform this later, and not at boot time? Ideally, we could add this into a component (similar to other `Query` components) and `AsyncLoad` it so it doesn't increase bundle size, since it's not critical functionality.

One-liner functions are often redundant and can be inlined. I think that's the case here.

Same suggestion regarding the one-liner function.

Updated. Moved logic to separate component.

@tyxla @gmovr  To ensure that the resurrection event doesn't fire indefinitely, I am allowing 
5 minutes in which the resurrection event can be fired after the user logs in.
- Question, would it be better to use local storage as a way of preventing events firing indefinitely i.e Once the event fires, we store a value locally to prevent further resurrection events.  Then increase this time gap in code from one 5 minutes to an hour?

```suggestion
The time frame between logins for one to be considered resurrected defaults to One year. However, this can be changed in the component props.
```

This part is a bit unclear, I'm not sure what it means by:

* Passing one or both of:
* An `yearInterval` integer e.g 2 defaults to 1

```suggestion
	<TrackResurrections yearInterval={ yearInterval } />
```

Do we really need `yearInterval` to be a separate prop? I think it could easily be a constant somewhere. I doubt we'd want to use this with two or more different values, and if we do, we can always add such a prop. 

See the [YAGNI principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it).

We could use that directly from `react`.

The calculation is ideal for a constant. We usually do them like this:

```
const YEAR_IN_MILLISECONDS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365;
```

and then we use it in the code.

It could greatly improve the readability of the code. 

Is there a need to return `null` here? Can we just `return` void?

We likely should rename the constant, since it's not really ""days"".

Also, I don't understand the need for this additional check.  Given that we immediately update the login time of the user, and we make sure that it runs only once, why do we need that extra check?

Hm, I see it will run only once, but if it runs and then the user is still fetching, it will never re-run after the user has re-fetched. Thoughts?

Feel free to ignore connected props here.

And if we end up removing `yearInterval` as I suggested above, we might remove the entire `propTypes` and `defaultProps` objects.

Have you considered using TypeScript? It would reduce the need for `propTypes` completely.

We already have a `isFetchingUserSettings()` selector that we should be using here.

Given that this is a functional component, I'd suggest using the `useSelector()` hook instead of connecting the component.

Is this the place where we want to put this? Jetpack sites don't have a ""My Home"" page, so this just won't run for users whose primary (or only) site is a Jetpack site.

I'd suggest async-loading this. It's not really essential/critical functionality and can definitely be delayed and loaded later.

Good catch, thanks updating ....

@tyxla  void doesn't seem to be a valid child and throws an error
https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#booleans-null-and-undefined-are-ignored

Noted thanks. Updating ...

Going to test against Jetpack and relocate appropriately.

Okay, two things:

1. Sorry for the confusion, I didn't mean literally `void` but rather an empty `return`:

```
if ( isFetchingUserSettings ) {
	return;
}
```

2. The link you sent applies to what we return when rendering, while the context we're talking about here is within a React `useEffect()` hook. 

This has been removed as its no longer necessary.

The component doesn't have any more properties. This was fixed.

Year interval was removed in the latest implementation.

This has been updated to reflect the requested change.

We are now using isFetchingUserSettings select as requested.

This is now being loaded using async-loading

The component doesn't have a yearInterval prop any more.

The updated component doesn't have any props anymore.

Updated to use the recommended useSelectore as this is a functional component.

The yearInterval prop was removed in the changes and changes reflected in the README.md

So I found the three other landing pages from the function getLoggedInLandingPage i.e
`/home/${ primarySiteSlug }`;
`/stats/${ primarySiteSlug }`;
and '/read';
And I would like to add the resurrection component to each of them.
However, I need guidance on the recommended way to include AsyncLoad to the files outside the client folder, e.g., in the HighlightCards component, as it's in the packages library outside the client library. This component is displayed on the landing page of jetpack sites
https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/2362c74ba7803cd595339cb16c80b2fbb6d06331/packages/components/src/highlight-cards/index.tsx

Thanks, this was fixed.

I wouldn't recommend putting `<TrackResurrections />` inside a generic component that can be used anywhere.

Instead, I'd recommend putting it alongside the `<HighlightCards />` instances, even if we have to insert it in multiple places.

Nitpick: do we need both `useSelector( getUserSettings ) ?? {}` and `userSettings?.`?

😍 I'd love to build the backend for that, just be aware we don't have a way to hook into that yet

Can we not do urls, but return entity ids, so the client can build whatever operation is appropriate for an entity ?

So if it's a workflow_id, you could view, edit, run, download etc ... ?

Take a look at `WarningReason`, `FailureReason`, `CancelReason` ? That way we also don't need to hook into the backend routing for generating routes 

Ups copy&paste is ruled by the devil :sweat_smile: Thanks!

Ahh good to know, those categories are just potential ideas for the moment, I'll disable that one for now.

Sure, that was the idea. Have a look at `WorkflowExecutionCompletedNotificationContent` below.

This `ActionLink` is only used in *Broadcasted notifications*, which are generic, and this is a naive attempt to support ""Actions"" or ""Buttons"" that can register specific actions.

For example, imagine creating a survey that gets displayed to every user (as a broadcasted notification), and there are a couple of options, those options could be links to a potential API endpoint (inside or outside Galaxy) that register the response. 
Or another example is when you click ""Agree"" on a privacy policy or cookie agreement. There would be an `agree` action link that points somewhere to read the terms, etc... But maybe it is too generic... :thinking: 

Those action links are supposed to be written by the admin or the person in charge of creating those special notifications, so they are not generated by Galaxy.

Ah, great, for outside links that makes a lot of sense.

Ohh wait, I see what you mean, the `share_link` below should go :sweat_smile: 

Could you, please, move the revision script into its own commit? I haven't seen a case (yet) when we'd need the revision commit without the corresponding model change commit, but that was one of the ""lessons learned"" items in a 2014 PyCon Alembic talk, and I do think it's a good approach (if anything, that's more granular commits, which may be convenient).


We are dropping all mapping tests. It's not merged yet only because it got stuck in a large SA2.0 PR which is not yet ready for review. There's a more detailed explanation in the backend meeting minutes from 1/31/23 (see  bullet point 1.3). So this file will be dropped. (sorry for any wasted time - I should've dropped those already)

near_quota_limit should also be disabled for now I assume (push back if I'm wrong). We present a quota bar to the user in the UI - the client could just look at this and decide what to do - rather than having to check and fire this every time we write any object in Galaxy. 

This is overall wonderful. I'd love to see the notifications implemented - the sharing stuff seems like a good start. There is also a job completion -> email hook in Galaxy that you can probably piggy back off of to build another useful thing pretty quickly. 

maybe add very brief inline comments (on the right?) explaining what there are? Like what you have in the data models table in the description of this PR. That would be very helpful for anyone reading the model definition code down the road.

Does the `variant` field imply a scale? (""Defines the 'importance' of the notification."") If so, maybe use an integer instead? Not only will that give us more flexibility (avoid the need for ""high"" vs. ""somewhat high"" vs. ""very very high"", etc.), we also get natural ordering.

Both fixtures can be dropped (together with the mapping tests) - again, sorry about that!

No worries! I had a vague feeling/memory this was the case but since the tests were already there in the original PR... I didn't think of it too much :man_shrugging: 

I'll drop them :+1: Thank you!

Thank you! That makes a huge lot of sense @jmchilton!

I'll look into the job completion hook :+1:

The idea was more along the line of something like ""info"", ""warning"", ""urgent"", etc. that can be used to render or highlight the notifications differently (colors, icons, etc.). I think the ordering should be always by date, but this `variant` can be used for filtering, i.e. display only ""urgent"" notifications.
Of course, these enums can be mapped as integers in the DB if this is more desirable, I just thought they are more readable as strings, but I'm happy to change that if this is more optimum :)

Ah, I see. Those values are more informative than a simple integer scale - let's keep them as strings then.
With regard to the database, it's all the same here. Thanks for the explanation!

The value of `job_config_file` does not change in `config/__init__.py` if it is not set. If it *is* set, and we can't find it, we check against root - but that's it.

@jdavcs I guess what you are missing is that the default is not `job_conf.xml` any more, but `job_conf.yml`, so we are checking 2 different things.

Oh, I see! Now it makes sense. Thank you :)

Right, I guess one should see the warning irrespective of the file's existence

I think it would be better to set `job_config_file` to the old default file *only if* that file exists, so that if neither of the default files is found, the `log.warning()` in the `except OSError:` branch complains with `Job configuration ""job_conf.yml"" does not exist, using default job configuration`.

right! forgot to remove that one

you mean just changing it to `it.handle().object().id.val()`, right? For me that seems to works as well.

It probably should also be changed on [line 244](https://github.com/tyrasd/Overpass-API/blob/200debd2dd02d513f5c31a8d5a826d9922f62008/src/overpass_api/statements/area_query.cc#L244)…

I had  `it.handle().id()` in mind - we have something similar elsewhere but I don't know  if this also works in this context without further checking.

ah, yes, that makes more sense :see_no_evil: -> 4d9992d

I think even the .val() at the end is not needed as id() already returns the right type. Can you maybe test this again?

Then I get the following compile-time error (gcc 6.2):

> error: no match for ‘operator==’ (operand types are ‘long long int’ and ‘Area_Skeleton::Id_Type {aka Uint32_Index}’

Uint32_Index has the == operator implemented only for comparing with other Uint32_Index values while Area_Query_Statement (for some reason) stores the id it gets in a 64bit integer.

But I think that calling `.val()` here shouldn't be an issue, since the compiler can inline/optimize that away very easily.

Ok, fine, let's keep val(). I didn't have the source available when commenting and didn't exactly remember when it was necessary.

why not use the filter here also instead of adding a parameter to the method?

@Tabrisrp is some previous CR @engahmeds3ed told me to not add filters inside filters inside the Query.

I don't understand why it would be different from the current implementation 🤔 

@Tabrisrp  You have an example of current implementation [here](https://github.com/wp-media/wp-rocket/blob/ef300cf2d46e837789f9ad42ff8166c832a47dc3/inc/Engine/Preload/Database/Queries/Cache.php#L666) where the filter is declared [here](https://github.com/wp-media/wp-rocket/blob/ef300cf2d46e837789f9ad42ff8166c832a47dc3/inc/Engine/Preload/Controller/PreloadUrl.php#L191).

		$query               = ""SELECT id FROM `$prefixed_table_name` WHERE `last_accessed` <= date_sub(now(), interval $delay)"";
```

I still don't understand why we can't do that?

Let's discuss about it and at last we get a rule to be applied.

Sure filters can be added anywhere, what I wanted to say is this is the query class which deals directly with the database so those methods here should be more generic and deals with arguments instead of using WordPress hooks here.

I think this is to separate the business logic layer from database layer (Separation of concerns concept).

This is my proposed idea, plz let me know what do u think about it?

if we do it like that we need to find a different way to pass the value to the parameter, a string like this is not great

@Tabrisrp I changed the method params to adapt to it.

```suggestion
		$value = 1;
		$unit   = 'month';

		if ( count( $parts ) !== 2 ) {
			$value = $parts[0];
			$unit   = $parts[1];

We should instead either store the names in memory, or load them all at startup and store them in memory.

I would vote for the simpler implementation of just loading them all as a JavaScript variable at startup (so no filesystem access at all.)

This strikes me as a potentially expensive query. Do you think we could come up with a less expensive way of generating these names?

Some ideas:
- Generate names in a sequential manner, so we always follow a particular order
- Generate names by hashing the user's email, and somehow associating the hash with the anonymous name (not so anonymous anymore perhaps?)
- Preload a randomized list per queue, hold it in memory as long as the queue is running, and sequentially pop from it (can you think of where this might fall short? Consider that we may run on more than one host.)
- Can you think of other ways?

(Also, validate my assumption; is this actually expensive?)

---

Separately, storing the name mapping at the queue level solves this issue, but introduces other issues -- see my comment on the PR for more.

Would be nice to move this logic to a lib file.

Consider that we can have more than one student (and thus anonymous name) per ticket.

Also, let's lean towards specificity and verbosity in database models... no need to shorten variables!

s/hiddenFields/protectedFields/?

Also, we can use modern JS features to minimize our dependency on underscore. This part can be written as:

```js
Object.assign(Meteor.users.publicFields, { ... });
```

Let's not expose all of `services.google`, only the fields we expect users to need.

As a meta note, I wonder if it's better to make `publicFields`, `privateFields`, and `hiddenFields` mutually exclusive. That way we combine them at the publication level. Thoughts?

Do we need to publish `services.google.email`?

As noted in the PR comment, we could avoid subscribing to the users altogether.

This subscription should probably be at the queue level, if at all?

If we want to filter by both user IDs and course ID, let's create a new publication called `users.byIdsAndCourseI`. I'm not fully convinced we need this though.

This list is awesome! Where did you find it?

""Andy"" 

🤔 

Let's skip this guy since it's a two-word animal.

🎃 🙅‍♂️ 🐕 

I wanna say we should skip two word animals... but Nyan Cat though.

I don't think this is too expensive. How many tickets are active in the largest queues? 100? And this is run each time a ticket is created so in a queue with 100 active tickets we'll end up requesting 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 99 + 100 = 5050 tickets from mongo over the course of the time it takes to create these tickets (which could be something like an hour). I think this is well within the bounds of what mongo and meteor are capable of handling. I don't really think any of the ideas you listed are good solutions and I don't think coming up with a better solution is worth the effort at this point (premature optimization is the root of all evil).

Won't `Object.assign` modify `Meteor.users.publicFields`?

Do you have any idea which fields that would be? There are several ids/tokens in there and I don't know what they're used for. I couldn't easily find anything online either.

Do we ever plan to use them separately? I imagine we'd want to combine them every time we use them, so it would be easier to just combine them when they're created and not have to worry about it later.

I copied them from http://www.grammaruntied.com/blog/?p=1175 but excluded the more negative ones.

I don't think it'll cause any problems...

should we do the flight recorder post before this one?

we should probably expand a bit on how this is explicitly opt-in for embedders and how we're only using it in VSMac today and not on any random user binaries that are executed with mono-project.com packages.

Every `one` _engineer_ who has to suffer `from`...

_The_ Modern software lifecycle...

...conversation can give _a developer_ a lot of information

I'd stay away from such politically charged tone here.
You can make the point that some user can be averse to tracking and can find telemetry to be such one of those.
Plus, you can say that the EU passed GDPR as a response to such concerns.

Avoid the self congratulatory tone. You can say the same without using it.

This phrase is confusing. How about:
```
More important than having our code open-source is to have good policies around privacy-preserving data collection. One of those polices, is on collecting Personally Identifying Information (PII).
```

We don't need to drop the GDPR hammer all over the place, it distracts people making them thing it's something to pay attention while reading your post.

You propose the question of what's PII, but don't answer it. The part about not collecting file paths and code in stack traces are awesome examples of doing so.

```
What's PII and how does it apply to bug reports? PII is any bla bla data that can be used to identify bla bla bla.
When it comes to bugs, it shows up in places like file path bla bla bla. Another important place are stack traces because bla bla bla.
```

What desire?

`Mono already has unique hashing functions for metadata objects; we use it inside of the AOT compiler and runtime.`
This fits better as part of answering that the solution is hashing. IE:

````
The solution to this is to generate a hash that is identical for two ...., while uploading ... - Mono already has such hash functions for metadata objects as our AOT compiler uses them
```


Why do we expose these abstract state machines? It's not clear what's the connection with the previous paragraph.



It's hard to make the connection of state machines, logging and flight recorders.
Maybe explain that the concrete way we realize those state machines is through logging and flight recorders. Plus give some high level overview (a few words) of what a flight recorder is. IE:

`Flight recorder is the name we give to lightweight logging doing using a circular buffer`  - or what you feel it's appropriate to mention here.

It looks like the original motivation was to prefer the latest ""known"" version in cases where `libasan.so` is older (such as when a new compiler is installed on an old LTS distro)?

there is this repo: https://github.com/arsenm/sanitizers-cmake
but could not see how they find the correct libasan.

I think it happens here: https://github.com/arsenm/sanitizers-cmake/blob/master/cmake/asan-wrapper.  Instead of attempting to ""find"" `libasan.so` explicitly, they just parse `ldd` output.

In our case, `ASAN_LIBRARY` variable is used to preload libasan into `ceph` tool (a Python program) so it's not directly applicable.  But anywhere where `ceph` tool is present, `rados` tool (a C++ program) should be present as well, so perhaps we could do what `asan-wrapper` does on that?

the wrapper is for runtime. i thought that if we don't specify `ASAN_LIBRARY` we fail at link time?

> the wrapper is for runtime. i thought that if we don't specify ASAN_LIBRARY we fail at link time?

i don't think we explicitly link to asan; when i set `WITH_ASAN=ON WITH_UBSAN=ON`, it adds these flags to both the compiler and linker lines: `-fsanitize=address;-fsanitize=undefined;-fno-sanitize=vptr;-fno-omit-frame-pointer`

the toolchain seems to be adding that library dependency itself, so `ldd` does seem like the best way to identify which

> In our case, ASAN_LIBRARY variable is used to preload libasan into ceph tool (a Python program) so it's not directly applicable. But anywhere where ceph tool is present, rados tool (a C++ program) should be present as well, so perhaps we could do what asan-wrapper does on that?

maybe we could put that logic in vstart_environment.sh instead? then the python commands wouldn't have to mess with it

we don't need to install `apt-transport-https` on Ubuntu 18.04 and later since apt supports https directly there

Unfortunately writing to /usr/share/keyrings requires privileged access.
Running gpg with sudo makes the user root which then requires accessing root's home folder to cache temporary keyring before moving it to its final destination.
This usage of gpg is not ideal and while unlikely to ever be deprecated requires this ugly hack which, agreed, I am also not very fond of.


By my searching, 16.04 seems to ship apt 1.2.35 which definitely does not have support for armored gpg keys but if I recall correctly that is not the case for the mono gpg key.
It should support signed-by feature just fine since it shipped with apt 1.1.

I did not run it on 16.04 yet but might try it in a bit.

Why not group all of these `RUN`s into one layer like the existing image?

Splitting it up (from my limited knowlege) allows if you change the lower ones the upper ones will be cached, meaning you won't have to run the higher ones nearly as often. Perhaps I missunderstood that though.

Nice! Didn't know that.

In my most recent PR I've organized it so that it _should_ cache installing the depenecies (changes infrequently). I found what helped the most was moving the COPY down. However It seems from this discussion that there's tradofs of caching for file size differences: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39223249/multiple-run-vs-single-chained-run-in-dockerfile-what-is-better

Yeah, I looked up that error hoping I could fix it, however after my reserach it seemed like there wasn't a great way to fix it, and it doesn't cause issues. I could create the directory that it's trying to access but I was afraid that would only add to the image size (not sure of that though)?

According to this ticket, https://github.com/mhart/alpine-node/issues/48, the correct way to add a user in Apline 3.7 is:
```
RUN \
      addgroup -g 1000 -S freegeoip && \
      adduser -u 1000 -S freegeoip -G freegeoip
```
The base image `golang:1.9-alpine` is currently running 3.6.2, but this still seems to correctly create the home directory:
```
echo $HOME
/home/freegeoip
```

@justgage there is a great Dockerfile best practices article here.  I thought I would pass it along.
https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/

Following these recommendations, specifically for [RUN](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#run), it will create a more readable Dockerfile:
```

This doesn't ensure that the snapshot is in fact primary.  Separately, I think we need to ensure that the snapshot doesn't belong to a different peer.

It appears that snapshot removal here is a fire-and-forget thing?  And that there can be potentially more than one in-flight since the loop in `scrub_incomplete_snapshot` isn't broken out of on the first match?

This is really dangerous because use-after-free can ensue if the rest of `CreatePrimaryRequest` gets done before `handle_scrub_incomplete_snapshot` is called.  Or, vice versa, `finish` might get called underneath a running `CreatePrimaryRequest` if snapshot removal fails.

line over 80 columns

This is going to need a new test case in `src/test/librbd/mirror/snapshot/test_mock_CreatePrimaryRequest.cc`.

And it looks like existing test cases would need to be tweaked too since they don't bother marking snapshots that they inject complete:

This seems wrong.  `snap_create` is one of the generic mock methods, why is it being constrained to mirror snapshots?

The new parameter doesn't make sense to me.  ""Completeness"" is reflected in the mirror snapshot namespace, which is already passed as `ns`.  If needed, the caller should just set `complete` before invoking `snap_create`.

It doesn't compile either:

> This seems wrong. snap_create is one of the generic mock methods, why is it being constrained to mirror snapshots?

It would be not possible to use it within expect_create_snapshot()

For example

```
                  Invoke([this, &mock_image_ctx, r](
                             const cls::rbd::SnapshotNamespace &ns,
                             const std::string& snap_name,
                             uint64_t flags,
                             ProgressContext &prog_ctx,
                             Context *on_finish) {
                           if (r != 0) {
                             return;
                           }
                           snap_create(mock_image_ctx, ns, snap_name);
                         }),
```

`ns.complete` is absent in the above case as `ns` is of type `const cls::rbd::SnapshotNamespace`  i.e its `const` and not of type ` cls::rbd::MirrorSnapshotNamespace`

I was able to compile it and execute the tests, not sure why it was not breaking compilation for me.

Is it ok if I declare a new `MOCK_METHOD6(snap_create, void(cls::rbd::MirrorSnapshotNamespace &snapshot_namespace, ...)` instead of editing `MOCK_METHOD5(snap_create, void(cls::rbd::SnapshotNamespace &snapshot_namespace, ...)` ? 





I wanted it to look realistic, i.e set ns.complete after snap_create() call.
Sure, noted this can be optimized. I will fix it as part of the next refresh.


> `ns.complete` is absent in the above case as `ns` is of type `const cls::rbd::SnapshotNamespace` i.e its `const` and not of type ` cls::rbd::MirrorSnapshotNamespace`

`cls::rbd::SnapshotNamespace` is a variant that can hold `cls::rbd::MirrorSnapshotNamespace` as one of the alternatives:
```
typedef std::variant<UserSnapshotNamespace,
		     GroupSnapshotNamespace,
		     TrashSnapshotNamespace,
		     MirrorSnapshotNamespace,
		     UnknownSnapshotNamespace> SnapshotNamespaceVariant;

struct SnapshotNamespace : public SnapshotNamespaceVariant {
```
See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant, in particular `std::get` and `std::get_if` methods.  One example of how it's used is just a few lines above the line that you are modifying in this PR ;)

> Is it ok if I declare a new `MOCK_METHOD6(snap_create, void(cls::rbd::MirrorSnapshotNamespace &snapshot_namespace, ...)` instead of editing `MOCK_METHOD5(snap_create, void(cls::rbd::SnapshotNamespace &snapshot_namespace, ...)` ?

No, because the real `snap_create` method also takes `cls::rbd::SnapshotNamespace`.

That said, I don't understand why setting an expectation on snapshot creation is desired.  It seems like incomplete snapshot creation could be part of the test setup and then the expectation could be just that `CreatePrimaryRequest` invokes `UnlinkPeerRequest` for a respective snapshot?

Hmm, that was my initial sketch too, but I see GMOCK is expecting it:

```
GMOCK WARNING:
Uninteresting mock function call - returning directly.
    Function call: snap_create(@0x7f9e3dff73f0 [mirror state=primary, complete=0, mirror_peer_uuids=uuid, clean_since_snap_id=head], @0x559ba2f35d78 "".mirror.primary.gid.b08f84a9-a556-4047-975a-6aeac23e3aa3"", 0, @0x559ba2f35db8 8-byte object <20-A1 88-A1 9B-55 00-00>, 0x7f9e20014d90)
NOTE: You can safely ignore the above warning unless this call should not happen.  Do not suppress it by blindly adding an EXPECT_CALL() if you don't mean to enforce the call.  See https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/docs/cook_book.md#knowing-when-to-expect for details.
```

Why is this parametrized?  Who would pass `false` for `complete` to `expect_create_snapshot`?

Since the comparison is against `info->complete`, I'd make `expect_unlink_peer` take `complete` and avoid the double negation (`ASSERT_NE` + `in`-`complete`).

Hrm, this appears to cause an infinite recursion loop between `CreatePrimaryRequest` and `UnlinkPeerRequest` when demotion and promotion is involved.  `TestMirroring.SnapshotPromoteDemote` test started segfaulting due to running out of stack space:
```
[ RUN      ] TestMirroring.SnapshotPromoteDemote
/home/jenkins-build/build/workspace/ceph-pull-requests/src/test/run-rbd-unit-tests.sh: line 20: 941196 Segmentation fault      RBD_FEATURES=$i unittest_librbd
```

INtresting!!
Should we just go with our first approach which was proposed initially?

Or Are you saying we need changes to `TestMirroring.SnapshotPromoteDemote` ?

Not now, it was futuristic.

Sure

Let's avoid anything ""futuristic"" ;)

The first approach was pretty broken and changing an existing test just to get it out of the way is a very bad idea.  Need to investigate what is going on there first -- perhaps demotion and/or promotion snapshots don't get marked complete in some cases (or at all)?

This is wrong.  If you look at the callers of `CreatePrimaryRequest`, `m_snap_id == nullptr` is just an indicator of whether the caller is interested in the ID of the snapshot that is created or not and this is exposed all the way up to the public API (see `rbd_mirror_image_create_snapshot` signature, for example).

What this would effectively do is prematurely mark _any_ mirror snapshot for which a user happens to not care about the ID as complete.  

> Currently snapshots created while promote operation are not marked complete.

Taking a step back, do you have an output or a log snippet to back this up?  If just tried a ""relocate"" operation (`rbd mirror image demote` on one cluster followed by `rbd mirror image promote` on another cluster) and both demotion and promotion snapshots appear to be complete:
```
    {

        ""name"": "".mirror.primary.4cacd615-32ab-46fc-a041-fe1b4a05705e.c318dfbc-ca9f-4ff9-bbb8-db94d1a9bcb7"",

            ""complete"": true
        }
    },
```
```
    {

        ""name"": "".mirror.primary.4cacd615-32ab-46fc-a041-fe1b4a05705e.e2a328ba-4103-40c5-b3cb-4e6d0e94deef"",

            ],
            ""complete"": true
        }
    }
```

As part of the promote we create a snapshot so we land in `CreatePrimaryRequest<I>::create_snapshot()  {} `, once snap create is done we will eventually we end up in `CreatePrimaryRequest<I>::handle_create_snapshot(int r){}`

`handle_create_snapshot()` will call refresh_image();.
Note `m_snap_id = null` at this point and `complete=false`

```
template <typename I>                                                   
void CreatePrimaryRequest<I>::refresh_image() {                         
  // if snapshot created via remote RPC, refresh is required to retrieve
  // the snapshot id                                                    
  CephContext *cct = m_image_ctx->cct;                                  
  ldout(cct, 15) << dendl;                                              
  if (m_snap_id == nullptr) {                                           
  ┆  ┆ unlink_peer();                                                      
  ┆ return;                                                             
  }
  [...]
}                                                                     
```

Since `complete=false` in the unlink_peer() we will attempt to delete the snapshot.

In addition to `if (m_snap_id == nullptr){}` use in `CreatePrimaryRequest<I>::refresh_image()`, I also see `CreateNonPrimaryRequest<I>::create_snapshot()` doing ` ns.complete = is_orphan();`

Where:
```
bool is_orphan() const {               
┆ return m_primary_mirror_uuid.empty();
}                                      
```
m_primary_mirror_uuid is the 3rd argument to `CreateNonPrimaryRequest<I>::create()`

```
[0] pkalever 😎 ceph✨ git grep -n ""CreateNonPrimaryRequest"" | grep ""::create(""
src/librbd/mirror/snapshot/PromoteRequest.cc:62:  auto req = CreateNonPrimaryRequest<I>::create(
src/tools/rbd_mirror/image_replayer/snapshot/Replayer.cc:972:  auto req = librbd::mirror::snapshot::CreateNonPrimaryRequest<I>::create(
```

Checking only PromoteRequest.cc here, as that's what we care:

```
void PromoteRequest<I>::create_orphan_snapshot() {
[...]
  auto req = CreateNonPrimaryRequest<I>::create(
  ┆ m_image_ctx, false, """", CEPH_NOSNAP, {}, {}, nullptr, ctx);
  req->send();
}
```

Should we also consider the CreatePrimaryRequest:create_snapshot() comes as part of the promote operation as a orphan snapshot and do the same magic?

I don't see any other better option!


Thanks!

> Since `complete=false` in the unlink_peer() we will attempt to delete the snapshot.

Then the original fix is also wrong and the logic in `CreatePrimaryRequest::unlink_peer` needs to be adjusted a bit more.  The desired behavior is as follows: after creating `snap2` (current snapshot), `snap1` (previous snapshot that is expected to have been marked complete by now) should be removed if it's still incomplete.

Your description makes it sound like there is a case where `snap2` (current snapshot, i.e. one that has just been created and is obviously incomplete because the associated image state data hasn't been written out yet) is removed.  That should never happen -- the current snapshot should be allowed through to give it a chance to get marked complete later, outside of `CreatePrimaryRequest`.


> I also see `CreateNonPrimaryRequest<I>::create_snapshot()` doing ` ns.complete = is_orphan();`

This is not relevant as we are only concerned with primary snapshots here.

I had updated it to skip UnlinkPeerRequest for recent mirror snapshot. PTAL

This won't work because `m_snap_id` may be `nullptr`.  It's legitimate, and, as established in earlier comments here, actually happens to be user input.

It's pretty obvious that unit tests weren't run on this change...

This comment edit drops useful information (""happens if mirroring is enabled on a pool with no peers configured or if UnlinkPeerRequest gets interrupted"").

Actually, this reminded me about something from last week.  Unrelated to the ""skip"" issue, I think we should be more careful here and act only on those incomplete snapshots that are linked with the peer at hand (and leave the comment intact since it would remain very much on point).  Something like this:
```
      // call UnlinkPeerRequest only if the snapshot is linked with this peer
      // or if it's not linked with any peer (happens if mirroring is enabled
      // on a pool with no peers configured or if UnlinkPeerRequest gets
      // interrupted)
      if (!info->mirror_peer_uuids.empty() &&
          info->mirror_peer_uuids.count(peer) == 0) {
        continue;
      }
      if (info->mirror_peer_uuids.empty() || !info->complete) {
        peer_uuid = peer;
        snap_id = snap_it.first;
        break;
      }
      count++;
```

I spent the evening looking into this and I came up with a fix: https://github.com/idryomov/ceph/commit/13b78573b4e3fc56cdef22033168aacfc59b1123
@pkalever Please try it out, including injecting a crash as before as that is the only actual reproducer we have.

> m_snap_id may be nullptr

@idryomov 

Ouch! I completely forget about this while pushing the changes, my actual testing changes take care about nullptr (tested on a different machine), something like:

```
// skip UnlinkPeerRequest for recent mirror snapshot
if (m_snap_id != nullptr && snap_it.first == *m_snap_id) {
  continue;
}
```

I think the below is there for a reason, If you don't see any issue with above, can we live with it without discarding below?
```
 // if snapshot created via remote RPC, refresh is required to retrieve
  // the snapshot id
  if (m_snap_id == nullptr) {
    unlink_peer();
    return;
  }
```

Sure, makesense!

> can we live with it without discarding below?

We can't because skipping the entire loop iteration would mess up `rbd_mirroring_max_mirroring_snapshots` logic. 

That might be fixed like:

But with your proposed fix aren't we missing to call `unlink_peer()` itself in `void CreatePrimaryRequest<I>::refresh_image()` when `m_snap_id == nullptr` ?

> That might be fixed like:

Did you test that at all?  Besides leaving `m_snap_id == nullptr` case unhandled, it quite obviously breaks `rbd_mirroring_max_mirroring_snapshots` logic because `snap_it.first == *m_snap_id` is likely to be true for the last iteration (i.e. newest snapshot), meaning that `max_snaps` would be decremented right before bailing out of the entire loop which makes the whole change useless.


> But with your proposed fix aren't we missing to call `unlink_peer()` itself in `void CreatePrimaryRequest<I>::refresh_image()` when `m_snap_id == nullptr` ?

We aren't -- `unlink_peer()` is called unconditionally before returning from `refresh_image()` there.



> We aren't -- unlink_peer() is called unconditionally before returning from refresh_image() there.

Ah! didn't notice this one (sorry for the mess, was switching between multiple things)
Thanks will align to the fix your proposed and test it a bit and send it.

I don't think blockquote renders correctly (the border is still on the left side)

instead of providing a suggestion on how to update CSS here, it's better the add rtl-conditional style overrides directly to `_scss/_base.scss`, like this (I haven't tested the code below, so please adjust as necessary):
```scss

sorry, I'm not as familiar with multi-directional language support. what does this do?

Happy that you find it useful :) . I have to clarify one important fact: I'm by no means dominant on HTML, SCSS, and I'm afraid, even after going through Jekyll's documentation several times, I haven't fully comprehend its philosophy. So please take my response with a grain of salt, i.e., modify it as you feel it's better.

Coming back to your comment, I actually don't know how to add it to `div` here. If you provide me with some hints, I would be happy to work on it.

It's merely a demonstration that shows code blocks stay left-to-right even if the language script is not. Now that I think of it, the code is a bit misleading... :)

The same. Just for demonstration.

I agree. As a matter of fact, the content of this post addresses this issue (although in Persian -- if you use chrome or firefox you may want to translate the whole page to English. Translation is decent in my experience). That said, I was unsuccessful in fixing this issue. Maybe adding `rtl` to `div` resolves this.

I'll check this locally, and push a new commit if it worked on my side.

TBH, I don't know much rather than `bidi` handles bi-directional scripting in the correct way. Often right-to-left scripts are not equal to a right-aligned version of a left-to-right script. Text becomes more shattered if there are numbers or special characters involved as well. Yet, with smart conditioning, one can prevent the misplacement of phrases. I guess, what bidi does is take care of all those cases.

Why these particular key-values are necessary to fix this, I don't know. I had [this](https://stackoverflow.com/q/19997153/7106957) problem and (almost) followed the accepted answer. In my case, it worked.

Hi, Thanks for this great idea. 

It is a common practice ([+](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47376504/4201765)) to add `dir=rtl` in a separate div. So, maybe it is better to add it like this:
```html
<div {% if site.rtl_langs contains page.lang %} dir=""rtl"" endif %>
Stuff
</div>
```

Also, I see that you have added `align=right`. Why do you think that is necessary? I haven't seen it anywhere. 

Hi, 
I was not aware of this practice, but it seems to work on my local machine. 

`align=right` is to decouple the text of each post from the body of the page which have some use cases. E.g., one might want to have the header and navigation in, say English, but the posts in a rtl script. An example post is [here](https://arashgmn.github.io/blog/2022/dialogue-prerequisites/).

Using nodeFetch here would not be so easy since we're trying to override the default HTTP timeout for outgoing requests. Fetch Api doesn't seem to provide a native support for this use-case, while Axios does. Hence we went with this library.

Thanks for raising this, I didn't realise axios was not part of our dependency but it was indeed part of dependency tree by some other package, that's y it seems be be working before. Now, I've also added it to our dependency now :)

Redundant white space.

What will happen if the user presses ""back"" while this is in operation? 

Should this not be in the subscription? In the case that the change request is slower than the update, it will look to the user like nothing has changed. You want to update once you are sure the server has received your request.

Usually the first letter of services is not capitalized (see below).

Please make sure this is closed upon destruction of the page. @HendrikPreuter had to do that for a lot of pages and should now how to do this.

Why did you make this into a separate page? Would it not have been simpler to create a modal?

I double checked, actually, this is a modal. Seeing that it is a modal (and very small at that), I think the amount of boiler plate (lines of code that do not contribute directly to the implementation) is a little out of control here. Would it be sensible to make these components at the level of the settings folder?

Capitalisation as mentioned earlier.

What is this time out doing here?

This label is cut off at some sizes (with my email address when the view port width is 425px), which looks a little weird. I think going vertical with the labels make more sense for responsive stuff here.

Syntactic sugar for this would be 
```ts
this.gravatar = `https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/${set.avatar}`;
```

This is still a work in progress I take it?

By the fact that this is referred to as a component I am pretty sure you can make these things components instead of pages.

The page goes to the page visited before going to the settings page. The popover remains visible until the bio update is complete.

Yes, indeed

Great, I am going to assume you tested this?

Just out of curiosity, why do we need the `-jakarta` adapter packages? No adapters should use Jakarta EE, AFAIK.

We're actually planning on getting rid of `app-server-wildfly`, so that's not a solution as this would basically block our ability to remove the WildFly adapters.

Would it be a completely crazy idea to move adapter tests to `tests/adapter` leaving them as javax, with the embedded Undertow app server, but only supporting running with auth-server-quarkus rather than embedded auth-server?

@stianst Using app-server-wildfly is just a temporary solution until we have a Quarkus 3 Alpha release with Hibernate 6. After that, we'll use app-server-undertow and auth-server-quarkus.

Currently, we need to use Jakarta EE-based auth-server-undertow.

Yep, it's only temporary, same as for WildFly app server. I wanted to keep the default Undertow app server wherever it's possible for a better simulation of the environment. But I think the other jobs don't use the app server a lot. Removed

Exactly as @vmuzikar mentioned. 

Not following. Are you saying we're not going to be able to run the auth-server-undertow anymore to run tests from within the IDE?

We will be able to run general tests(not adapter tests) in IDE with auth-server-undertow. We need a different default app-server for the adapter tests (AFAIK, ATM, Undertow auth and app server run in the same JVM). I was thinking about the separation of these instances to different JVMs, and totally missed, that we have embedded Undertow :)) 

It'll be a better solution. Thanks.

@mabartos Do you plan to rework this PR to use undertow embedded?

@vmuzikar Maybe it would be good to do it in a follow-up task as the fix for adapters itself is included here and confirmed it's working. WDYT?

@mabartos Works for me, it's temporary and limited to this branch in any case. The PR LGTM then.

fwiw, we're generally using poetry now.

Right, I switched off it for testing locally. Sorry. I reverted the code.

This feels a little strange, generally custodian models control plane resources and configurations. we don't generally expose data plane things as a resource. having individual audit api records as a resource feels like a mismatch.

What's the goal / use case for this?

 We do query data plane resources for specific functionality (filter/action) against a control plane resource, like auto tagging in the context of azure uses the activity log to determine creator.


Our team have developed resources/filters for covering several security standards.
This resource covers one of the standards. If it's required we can create a set of resources/filters with corresponding rules in standards. Does it make sense?

could you cite the standard here or explain the use case a bit more?  ie. as an analogy we typically ensure cloud trail or bucket configuration, not individual records or objects in those which could number in the billions.

we use activity-log-alert for covering CIS standard (v7 (1.4,1.5), v8 (1.1)) - Each tag consists of a name and a value pair, which makes resource administration easier. We can create a table for these and other resource and in which standards we use the resources. How do you think, does it make sense?

you'll have to be a little more specific re which cis standard or benchmark your referencing. v7 and v8 correspond to generic critical security controls. the latest azure specific benchmark is CIS Microsoft Azure
Foundations Benchmark v1.5.0 - 08-16-2022 none of the listed controls (1.1, 1.4, 1.5) correspond to functionality in the pr.

Yes, this works, until you hit the character limit, then you have to get more creative.

> Hardcoding some integer conversion would be somewhat limiting then imo

How so? This algorithm creates a one to one mapping between a string and an integer, so limits stay the same. (Assuming the language uses some big integer implementation of course).

> show some existing implementations that actually do

Sure! In the [MSC](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3230) I referenced, there's
- [Element Android](https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/blob/3dc7a6dc3411452f4a7a1531081e3e970574e1b3/matrix-sdk-android/src/main/java/org/matrix/android/sdk/api/util/StringOrderUtils.kt#L78) which creates collisions as multiple strings map to the same number. For example ""A"" and ""AA"" are both 0 when they should be 1 and 2 respectively.
- [Element Web](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/blob/9c8093eb3e140385c8f1a5763e0c0a099584238b/src/utils.ts#L551) which creates gaps as the strings don't map to a contiguous set of numbers. For example ""A"" and ""AA"" map to 27 and 36 respectively. The gap is problematic when doing midpoint calculations as you can imagine.

> In the end lexical strings can always be compared correctly without converting them to numbers.

Comparison is easy to do correctly but calculating the midpoint between two strings is not and that is what I'm solving with this MSC.

> How so? This algorithm creates a one to one mapping between a string and an integer, so limits stay the same. (Assuming the language uses some big integer implementation of course).

You would need to resend all space children events whenever you reorder rooms. The current implementation allows for resending just a single event.

I'm not sure where I lost you but this MSC doesn't affect the number of events sent. Element Web and Android currently convert the order strings to integers but they're doing it wrong. This MSC proposes a correct way to do the conversion.

Currently space events have an ordering, which uses these strings. Lets assume you have 2 elements, using 2 consecutive strings:

- A
- AA

Those map to 1 and 2 using your algorithm. Now you want to insert into the middle of those. Using your algorithm, you would need to renumber AA, because you don't have fractions:

- A
- AA <- new element
- AAA <- renumbered

With the current spec, you can inset a new Element without renumbering

- A
- A0 <- new element.
- AA <- no renumbering

This always works as long as the first and second Element are not both of the max string length (50) AND have a distance of only 1 or the second Element is not a single space. You have to be very intentional to break that.

Your algorithm however makes it very easy to break by accident. If only """", ""A"", ""AA"" are the 3 smallest numbers, then clients will start making the first space in a list """", and the second one ""A"". Then moving any space up  to the top there means you need to renumber everything after it.

You can still make broken orders in the existing spec, that need lots of reorderings to update the space list, but I would say with your approach it is significantly more likely. Yes, the existing spec makes the midpoint calculation harder, but only if you want an exact midpoint. In most cases finding some string in between is already enough.

I guess you could fix that by not making the mapping strict integer mappings, but still allowing the floating behaviour where you can just make the original string longer to add more insertion points, but currently your proposal removes that.

I've gone back to reread my MSC and I think I see where the confusion is from.

> For the sake of simplicity, I will be limiting the range of characters to be just A, B and C with a limit of 3 characters.

This limitation I stated here was for the sake of explanation. I'm not actually saying we should change the dictionary that's currently use in the spec, I'm saying that the explanation below will use a small dictionary just so it's easier to comprehend.

> With the current spec, you can inset a new Element without renumbering

0 isn't a valid character in my example so you wouldn't be able to use it.

> Your algorithm however makes it very easy to break by accident. If only """", ""A"", ""AA"" are the 3 smallest numbers, then clients will start making the first space in a list """", and the second one ""A"". Then moving any space up to the top there means you need to renumber everything after it.

I could say the same thing for the existing spec's dictionary.

If only """", "" "", ""  "" are the 3 smallest numbers, then clients will start making the first space in a list """", and the second one "" "".

I'm not changing the difficulty of midpoint calculation (this algorithm definitely wasn't the easiest to come up with), I'm just fixing a common bug in one of the steps.

> In most cases finding some string in between is already enough.

Sure, but who wants to deploy code that only works most of the time, instead of all of the time.

> I guess you could fix that by not making the mapping strict integer mappings, but still allowing the floating behaviour where you can just make the original string longer to add more insertion points

I'm not sure what your issue is with strict integer mappings but when you have a max length and a finite set of characters, the set of all possible strings is finite. Which means you can represent every possible string with a unique integer.

> but currently your proposal removes that.

No it doesn't. My proposal provides a reliable way for clients to do midpoint calculations correctly.
It is up to clients to make sure that when they assign order strings that they do it in an evenly distributed fashion to allow plenty space for inserting without renumbering.

See this thread [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3230#discussion_r651809451). The ""Recommended algorithm to compute mid points:"" section is precisely what I'm trying to fix. Nothing more, nothing less.

Yes, that would make sense too.

It's a bit frustrating that we need to set out special rules for each type of to-device message, rather than laying out a generic framework for cancellable and expiring to-device messages. It feels like something of a layering violation, and feels like we're always going to be extending this list (with consequent extra work for server implementations).

I would extend this to include semantically equivalent to-device messages. There's real world evidence that some clients will send request cancellations with the exact same request ID / requesting device ID many (>40) times.

I'm going to implement this in the sliding sync proxy because it is aligned with the core bandwidth / speed goals of MSC3575. Before implementing this though, I did some analysis on the size/kinds of to-device events that stack up on the proxy for clients:
 - The largest stack had a huge 237852 to-device events pending. This is uncommon, and rapidly drops off. The median is somewhere in the 100s.
 - Breaking down by event type, the vast majority by several orders of magnitudes are `m.room_key_request` events:
```
         event_type         | count  
----------------------------+--------
 m.room_key_request         | 121067
 m.room.encrypted           |    256
 m.secret.request           |     51
 m.key.verification.cancel  |     16
 m.key.verification.request |     13
```
 - By following the semantics in this MSC, I found that:
```
28089 to-device messages
14495 unique device|req_id tuples
1564 outstanding requests
12931 cancelled requests
260 multi-cancelled requests
potential savings: removing 26525 messages or 94.431984050696 %
```
- ""multi-cancelled"" requests are identical request cancellation events for the same request ID / requesting device ID.
- The 94% figure is consistent on large (100,000s events) accounts as well as mid-range (10,000s events) accounts. The smaller the stack, the less the benefit. On a device with 204 pending events, this MSC would remove 99 of them (48%).

There is real and immediate benefit to be had by implementing this MSC everywhere, particularly for `m.room_key_request` events which is the event type I did this analysis on.

It may be worth mentioning that it's especially bad with `@room` messages that currently re-notify many people in a room (most of the time noisily as well).

Oh, yes that does make it worse. 👍 

Since this matches on dotted keys, it might run into issues because of https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3873

Probably it is not an issue, since the m namespace is reserved and as such there should be no field with an ""m"" key. However, this might cause trouble when 3873 is merged, since this is the first pushrule matching on a dotted key, afaik.

It might be fine to ignore that on this MSC, I just wanted to mention it to be safe, if anyone has any smart ideas about it.

Thanks! I've included this under the potential issues section! 👍 

Another potential issue is that this breaks the use case of editing a message to include an additional push target. For instance, if you write a message and then edit it to put another user pill in it, in this case the user would not be notified.

An alternative solution would be to add a push rule with no actions and a condition to check whether a notification should have been generated for the user in the original message (following a capped number of `m.relates_to` jumps).

This should be placed as an override rule before the `.m.rule.contains_display_name` and the `.m.rule.roomnotif` [push rules](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#push-rules).

This seems significantly more complicated for an edge-case (IMO). Is it that common to edit a message to add another person?

It's worth noting that currently we have:

 1. `.m.rule.master`
 2. user-added override rules
 3. other default override rules.

Could you be more explicit about where in this ordering you think the new rule should go? The implementation at https://github.com/beeper/synapse/blame/beeper/rust/src/push/base_rules.rs#L98-L114 seems to put it at the start of (3), which seems about right?

Yep, that's where I'm thinking it should go! 👍  I'll re-word to be more explicit.

```suggestion
This rule should be placed before the [`.m.rule.suppress_notices` rule](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#default-override-rules)
as the first non-master, non-user added override rule.
```

```suggestion
A new default push rule is added to suppress notifications due to [edits](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#event-replacements).
```

```suggestion
The rule is ambiguous (see [MSC3873](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3873))
```

I agree this is an edge-case and I think we can descope it.

another issue seems to be around mobile clients, which might display a notification message when a DM is received, on the back of a push notification.

Currently, the mobile clients receive a push after each edit, which means they can update the text of an on-screen notification to show the updated content. The new push rule will of course inhibit the push, so the mobile client gets stuck with the old content.

I'm much of the opinion this is an unavoidable result of us trying to do too much magic with push rules, and that the new behaviour is probably a lesser evil. Still, worth calling out.

Good call. I've included some of that in the text.

I'm really starting to come around to needing to separate pushing vs. notifications, but that's quite a large change.

Maybe this goes without saying, but since MSC3873 is also proposed for FCP, I think the collision of these two MSCs is fairly obvious: we would update the `""key""` to be `""content.m\\.relates_to.rel_type""`.

Do I need to call this out at all?

I added some info into the alternatives section about this.

I fleshed out the potential issues section a bit more. Thanks!

I fleshed out the potential issues section a bit more. Thanks!

Thinking on this more, I wonder if this MSC is even necessary if MSC3952 lands. In that MSC we wouldn't create mentions *unless* the user is explicitly in `m.mentions: {user_ids: [...]}`. If you edit a message the edited content goes into `m.new_content`. This does mean we could reserve the top-level `m.mentions` for mention information:

* If it isn't provided (or is empty, in compatibility mode) then no mentions.
* But a client could optionally provide it if e.g. they added a new person to the original message, which case they could mention *just* that person.

It does put a bit more onto the client generating the message, but is a bit more stateless.

WDYT @anoadragon453?

Yeah, I'd say it's probably worth adding a sentence saying what the `key` would be under MSC3873.

This sounds to me like a reasonable solution.  The editing client can set the `m.mentions` so that it pings people who have been added, and avoid re-pinging people who have already been pinged.  Or it could maybe have the option to re-ping someone if the edit is significant and the sender thinks the recipient needs to re-look at the message?

@mscbot concern does MSC3952 make this unnecessary?

Thanks @uhoreg! Was just coming to cross-link https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/clokep/intentional-mentions/proposals/3952-intentional-mentions.md#impact-on-edits

This *might* still be useful as a short-term fix until clients start sending (and understanding) the `m.mentions` property?

I agree that MSC3952 could essentially replace this MSC, but that it would take longer to propagate.

I fear that there may be a likely scenario where a client ends up in a world where both intentional mentions and the `.m.rule.suppress_edits` push rule proposed by this MSC exist. Perhaps if the homeserver has added this push rule and the client itself supports intentional mentions.

In that case, the user of that client would not receive (unencrypted) notifications even if an edit explicitly added them to the `m.mentions` array, as the `.m.rule.suppress_edits` push rule would end up suppressing it.

Having both MSCs around at once may create a scenario where clients have to implement logic to explicitly disable the `.m.rule.suppress_edits` push rule in order to not break the use case of mentioning a user only in a message edit.

The only way I could see getting around this is by adding another condition to `.m.rule.suppress_edits` that the event does not contain an `m.mention` array in the `content`, effectively disabling this MSC if the sender of an event is using intentional mentions.

Do any other @matrix-org/spec-core-team members have thoughts on this concern?

Er, my thought is that short-term fixes to the push rules system end up making it even harder to reason about than it already is. If we think MSC3952 makes this redundant, then I would vote that we focus on getting that through. We've lived with spurious notifications from edits for four years; what's another few months?

Another argument in *favor* of this is that there may be other push rules that match the edit; mentions are just a subset of why you might get a duplicate notification, e.g. if you have keywords configured (or set a room to notify you for each message) then you would still get duplicate notifications without this MSC.

In light of @anoadragon453's concerns though, maybe this should be made a lower priority rule than some of the others.

Playing with the priorities a bit to try and work with MSC3952 I think would make sense. MSC3952 doesn't have the formal confidence written down yet, but given the context from other places it seems likely to be successful enough to be worth considering as a complimenting MSC.

Alright, so moving this down in priority...:

1. We still want things in `m.mentions` to potentially cause a notification (so we have to be after that).
2. We likely wouldn't want to be binged for keywords multiple times, but of course *do* want to be binged if an edit adds a keyword...

Hm, this makes me wonder if @anoadragon453 was onto something with:

> An alternative solution would be to add a push rule with no actions and a condition to check whether a notification should have been generated for the user in the original message (following a capped number of `m.relates_to` jumps).

I think that we will likely need to separate pushing vs. notifications in order to properly handle dismissing notifications on mobile platforms when the message is read on another device.

Taking into account intentional mentions (MSC3952), I think what we want to do is move this to be the first *under*ride rule (instead of the first *over*ride rule). With that the following could occur:

* Invites, tombstones, user, and room mentions should continue causing highlight notifications. ✅ 
* Edits to invites and tombstones would still result in a highlight notification (are edits of state events even valid?) ❌ 
* Legacy mentions would still result in highlight notifications. 🤷 
	* Edits to intentional mentions would not result in notifications due to MSC3952 logic. ✅ 
* Keywords would still result in notifications ✅ 
	* Edits to events with keywords would also result in notifications. ❌ 
* Edits to calls, messages, encrypted messages, messages in 1-to-1s, encrypted messages in 1-to-1s would all no longer notify. ✅ 

That all sounds good except for the edits to events with keywords. To get around that we could put the rule as the *last* override rule, so after `.m.rule.room.server_acl`. With that change we would fix the edits to events with keywords being an issue. Edits to invites / tombstones might still cause a notification, but I think that would be very uncommon?

That landed so I've updated this. 👍 

@anoadragon453 I'd be curious if the current reading of the MSC sounds good? I think it hits all your concerns.

> (are edits of state events even valid?)

technically yes, but silly and does nothing of value. The `m.new_content` isn't applied for things like event auth, so you're still dependent on the top level `content` keys existing, making it less effort to just `PUT` a new state event instead of crafting an edit.

The spec says it is [not valid](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.7/client-server-api/#validity-of-replacement-events):

> The replacement and original events must not have a `state_key` property (i.e. you cannot edit state events at all).


👍 (/me flips table as Ctrl+F failed to find that)

(just in case anyone is interested: https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/21851 demonstrates the sort of mess you get into if you allow state events to be edited)

The current reading of the MSC looks good to me indeed!

@VaibhavUpreti yah this is a good idea ... 
but for the 2nd idea ... the issue was its hard to see the pictures as they are so small so I added scaling maybe we can reduce the scaling a little bit because it's quite annoying to open full profile of user so I added this so you can quickly see who is the user maybe we can fix the styling in the scaling ... 
and for rounded images are you using border-radius ... i tried it but when there is rectangle pictures they result in oval shaped avatars or sometimes wirder shapes ...

@Arnabdaz for rounded avatar, I had added this with code in 3rd point of the [comment](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/3627#issuecomment-1449378729) mentioned above

For this IMO, having a small avatar might be alright, considering we can click it to visit dashboard to view enlarged picture. Also we may consider moving this to a sidebar in future, so rounded might be a better option. WDYT?

Need more context. I can't just ignore these changes as a reviewer. What it looks like tho is `backend-heat-map` is pointing to `master` rather than point to your prior pull request, and since you probably ran `git checkout -b backend-heat-map` from the `vanilla-bars-backend` branch, git is doing what it's supposed to.

nit: Rather than calling `videos.size()` twice, it might be more efficient to store that in a variable and use it throughout. I think technically this is okay because `.size()` is constant? (not sure) but if it takes O(n) and you're not modifying the array there's no need to call this method twice

is this PR supposed to be based against `master`?

I will git pull everything from master :'( 

How does this keep track of `num_videos`? Sorry I missed this in an earlier PR.

consider renaming to `numVideosRetrieved`, `videosRetrieved` sounds like a list of the retrieved videos

consider renaming `firstVideoCount` to `initialNumVideos`. `firstVideoCount` sounds like it could be the index of the first video, or some count associated with the first video in the list

I don't think you need this comment, you already have a comment explaining what `likedMusicHistory` is when you first initialize it

this comment doesn't really make sense to me, since it's not ""keeping track"" of `likedMusicHistory` but being used by it. `likedMusicHistory` also isn't part of this file, so that could come of as confusing to someone only looking at this file. consider rephrasing to something like ""used to determine the position of a newly retrieved video in comparison to already retrieved videos while obtaining more videos in segments""

You don't need this comment since you already have a comment defining what this variable is when you initiated it

+1. Probably something like ""currentVideoIndex"" will be clearest

You can get this info from the parent function. No need to return it here, and that in fact obscures what this function is doing, since it analyzes the videos but also returns the total number. Someone interacting with this function will likely write:
```
totalVideos += calculateMusicVideos(videos, totalVideos);
```

This means 2 independent things are happening on one line that aren't strictly tied together. More clear is:
```
calculateMusicVideos(videos, totalVideos);
totalVideos += videos.size();
```


See comment above. This should be split into 2 separate lines.

Do we need to prefix with `gdpr_` on our page?

`FormattableMarkup` please

Can you not grab bundles off of `$definition`? That surprises me...

Rather than duplicating the table code, you could do a count first and then inside the foreach handle the wrapper.

Possibly swinging the other way from by previous comment about things in the collector, but should the collector be doing filtering?

`FormattableMarkup` please

Although this is how it's structured in D7, I'm wondering if we'd be better having the filename defined per bundle, rather than on relationships? It does limit you in that you can't have the same bundle put into different files depending on the relationships, but that has issues if the same entity is applicable via multiple relationships (it will only appear in one file which may not be obvious)...

I think @jamieaa64 was suggesting we should actually go the other way and only explicitly include relationships. It's worse if we include data we shouldn't (i.e. data disclosure) than if miss data that should be included (i.e. incomplete fulfilment of SAR). Probably also worth trying to steer clear of double negatives as they just get confusing from both a UX and DX point of view.

We could combine this and the above into a single relationship field. It's never both, so could do something with constants. Can then have specific positive methods that do the comparison (e.g. `isOwner`, `followRelationship`).

Wouldn't all of this be better in `__construct` than in the create? Not even sure the benefit of a create here as we're not having to do things like container injection or similar.

Should probably also have `$entity_type_id` set against the field...

Do we have a general concept of enabled on fields? Config entities (which are at the entity level for us) can have a status, but if a config is disabled, we wouldn't pull the fields from it so wouldn't ever get to this stage...

When would this get used? I feel like we always deal with bundles...

Can we clean this up while we're here - don't need namespacing on global function as we shouldn't be defining them. Also, unless I've misunderstood the data structure, can we not just return (if set) `$this->bundles[$bundle][$field_name]` rather than all this array filtering?

Let's mention how they are keyed.

Let's mention how they are keyed.

I think keying them by something like `$bundle.$field` might be helpful?

Might be nice to have some structure, perhaps a `GdprTraversalResultInterface` which SARs and removal can implement? Can be documented as `@return GdprTraversalResultInterface[][]`... Might be for a future iteration though!

Or perhaps even a single `GdprTraversalResultInterface` which has an iterator and methods to access things by entity type etc... Just more thoughts...

Am I right in thinking this method actually does a recursive traversal? Naming is possible confusing...

If we use something like a `GdprTraversalResult` we can simplify the arguments a lot!

Let's not load more information until we need it, save memory and time. The next few statements exclude various possible scenarios, so do those first.

Do we need this as the previous block of code returns if it's not? I've a feeling IDEs can handle that..?

Perhaps it'd be better to have something that can be put in the entity annotation to always exclude an entity type? I know there are others that will end up like this (e.g. bookkeeping stuff when we do that).

Do we need to store the whole entity, or can we just use the ID? Although a reference to an existing object wont take up much memory, but may make debugging progress much more difficult...

Let's inject the config storage and use that rather than static calls.

As we already have our field config which is built making use of the available field definitions, can we use that as our basis? As we've moved towards explicit inclusion, we don't need to worry about un-configured fields. A simple `$entity->hasField($field_name)` call will protect against out of date configuration (or checking the result of `$entity->getFieldDefinition($field_name)`.

Similar question of whether `enabled` should exist or means anything in D8...

Let's not get the referenced entities until after exclusion checks as it will load all the entities etc which is time/resource intensive.

I would perform this check once, outside the `foreach`. It also needs to check whether we are trying to keep the same filename, as if we are not we should use pass in NULL. If we've got it outside the loop, we could do something a bit more consice like:

```php
$passed_row_id = (SINGLE_CARDINALITY && FILE_NAME_MATCHES) ? $row_id : NULL;
foreach ($referenced_entities as $child_entity) {
  $this->doTraversalRecursive($child_entity, $progress, $passed_row_id, $results);
}
```

If you query on a field without specifying a property, it will use the `::mainProperty`, which for ER is 'target_id'. I think let's let it handle that itself, as an extending class may use a different property name...

We don't want to pass `$row_id` in for owner relationships as we have to assume they are multiple cardinality.

Also, do we need to pass in the field config so SARs can get the filename?

From this being empty I'm assuming this would never be used directly, in which case let's make it an `abstract` class/method.

`enabled` again - let's get consensus and adjust everywhere as required.

This actually looks like a good candidate for full caching rather than just statically. The cache can get reset when field config entities are updated.

Not everything uses bundles, so I would start by checking that and avoid loading storage etc.

Do we still need this now we are not using the ctools dependency? I'm assuming those classes will become ineffective...

s/Entity/Entity type and use `$this->t()` (also in the other places).

Not sure if the form is the right place for the options to live... Perhaps a static method on the entity class?

Same here...

Worth using separate submit handlers rather than checking `#name`? That's probably more ""The Drupal Way<sup>TM</sup>""

Are these meant to be route parameters, or should it be the query key in the options argument?

Would it be better to have each form element call `$request->get(...)`? This approach will mean if you add something, you'll have to remember to add it here as well...

I think the entity builders should be able to handle all of this.

Also, this looks like `GdprFieldConfigEntity` is too complex... Perhaps we should make it so you can set values straight on the field, which handles writing back to the config entity. That way the entity builder can do something more like:

```php
$config->getField($bundle, $field_name)
  ->setRta()
  ->setRtf()
  ...;
```

Let's get rid of static calls! We're going to need to do some good test coverage of this and statics make it difficult.

If we're consistently having to do this load or create, we could extend the storage handler to have a `get($entity_type)` which would handle load vs create internally. Or even just do that directly in `::load()`.

We can build the fields with a default value and set `#access` to `FALSE` and it will pass through the value (I know this is copying my code, bad me!)

Also as mentioned previously we want to only follow explicitly and remove the double negative...

Once we change to a single setting configuring relationships, can we change to something like:

Title:
> How should this relationship be treated?

Options:
> - Do not follow this relationship.
> - This %entity_type_label owns the referenced %target_entity_label
> - This %entity_type_label is owned by the referenced %target_entity_type_label

Description:
> Owned entities are included in any task which contains the owner.

Title:
> Right to access filename

Description:
> Specify the filename for the <em>owned</em> entity to go in. Use %inherit to keep the related entity in the same file.

`%inherit` being `<inherit>` - which is a new feature to add into the SARs traverser as well.

We can move away from this being a static.

In a form, it's generally recommended to use `$this->t()`

We can take a look at the entity keys for the type and exclude a number of them, certainly uuid and bundle (and id we treat as delete the whole entity).

If this is to generate an empty option, that should be handled by setting `'#required' => TRUE`.

Should probably search the name as well as label.

You can create links directly from a route and text (as in you don't need `Url`).

I wonder if it would be better if we actually pass back a set of `GdprField`s and they have an easy way to get all the data - better than arrays where nothing is well defined...

Can we move this into the `GdprField` itself, can pass the field definition in to it...

I wonder if `getKeys` is too broad, for example `User::$name` is a key (I think) and the `label` key shouldn't make something un-editable.

Ooo this should DEFINITELY be a service, though maybe this MR does enough in one go already!

Hmm... where is this called from? It looks like the `gdpr_tasks.rta_traversal` service actually already handles all of this, in which case things calling this should probably call the service directly?

If we keep this, I'd be inclined to make it a one liner `return \Drupal::service('gdpr_tasks.rta_traversal')->traverse($user);`

I think this should be pulling from the generated CSVs at this stage?

This should probably be in the entity builder rather than the template preprocess, assuming it can be done quickly enough at render time.

What does the anonymizer need `@database` for? That seems a bit of a smell...

Can we make this actually link to the right page?

We probably need to also add in a `$result['deletions']` so they can happen inside the transaction.

s/RTF/RTA

Do we need this if we are building the CSVs first? Can we just render the CSVs like we do in D7? This could be quite intensive at run time on a large system...

If we are using `$this->assets`, can we clear it at the end as well?

Unfortunately it's not quite as simple as this, as the filename is based on the source, which could be an entity reference on another entity or an owner on this entity... In D7 I was also passing around the source plugin :'(

Perhaps one solution to this would be to use a [non shared service](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/shared.html) (so each call creates a new instance). Then we can use properties on the object much more safely. That may make the whole arguments stuff much simple and could have a source stack or similar to track where we are and how things relate.

At some point (probably follow up) it might be good to actually build the CSVs directly here rather than that being another loop over this data.

`image` and `file` both extend `entity_reference`, so I would be inclined to do a check of whether the item class is an instance of `EntityReferenceItem` (or `EntityReferenceItemList` if we have the list) and the target type is `file`.

`elseif` for all other instance of entity references which does `""{$entity->label()} [{$entity->id()}]""` or just `$entity->id()` if there is no label/it's the same as the id.

We need to deal with multiple cardinality here and loop over the field item list. Same for generic ER below.

Should we use `FieldItemListInterface::view` here as we can handle HTML markup?

This _may_ not be sufficient as the entity may not have a suitable edit form with for this particular field, but let's come back to that...

This needs to not happen directly in here as this is outside of the transaction.

Is `private` suitable, just wondering how likely this is to extended...

Probably `private` is better for that very reason :P

I've moved this to the collector. 

No. I'd kept the naming of these fields the same as the d7 version for consistency. Would you prefer I change them?

Done

Yes, I think let's rename - we don't need the namespacing.

No, you can't :(

Done

I think it's OK for the collector to do the filtering, although I'm not sure Collector it still the best name for it anymore as all the traversal stuff has been moved out. It's basically now just used for building viewdata for the UI. 

Done

I used a factory method for the explicit case where the GdprField is being created from an array of values used by the screen. The constructor just takes the bare minimum for the instance to function (eg in `GdprFieldConfigEntity::getField`). I've now merged the constructor and the create method, and I've added the entity type ID.

Enabled is tied to the ""This is a GDPR field"" checkbox. I've removed the concept of ""configured"" and only left ""enabled"" in place.

It's used when we traverse reverse relationships. We have to find all GDPR fields in the system regardless of entity or bundle that link to a particular entity type. 

I didn't add the namespacing when I created this, maybe it was done by the brainsum team? I've removed it again. Yes, the array filtering is no longer necessary now that we've moved to using bundle & field name as the array keys. I've cleaned that up. 

Done

Done

Done

I'd say private as we already provide ways to get the anonymizer (either via plugin or `gdpr_type_anonymizers` hook)

I've changed this to collect deletions into an array which are now handled inside the transaction by the `Anonymizer`

Done.

traverse is the root level method that we call (only once), and the recursion is done internally by doTraversalRecursive. I thought that was pretty clear but can change it if you like?

Yes, we need to replace them with something else as currently the filters appear one above the other. //cc @yanniboi 

Done

Moved to static methods on `GdprField`. Updated the settings form to use them too. 

Done

They're querystring parameters, but they still end up on the querystring this way as they don't match any of the route params. Would you prefer this to be explicit?

Sorry I'm not sure I understand. This method is used by the controller to extract the filters from the querystring, so we don't have access to the elements when it's used.

This is a static method that's called by a hook so can't inject things here :(

I'd prefer to keep `GdprField` as a fairly dumb DTO that doesn't have a dependency on it's parent `GdprFieldConfigEntity`. 

What I'll do instead is change this method to create and pass in a `GdprField` which will clean it up a bit, allow us to use method chaining but still leave it dumb. 

Let me know what you think and I can change it again if you prefer. 

Done

This is a static method called by a hook, so can't use `$this->t` here. 

I'm not sure what `inherit` is referring to here. @yanniboi can you take a look at this one?

It need to stay static as it's called from the static `buildFormFields` method,  which doesn't have access to the collector. Also, it doesn't use any of the collector's data so no need for it to be an instance method. 

Done

Yes it is to generate an empty option. I did this as setting the field to `required` means you can't submit the form if Anonymize isn't selected (as this dropdown is hidden). Is there another way around this?

Leaving this for now as it has an impact on the GdprFieldSettingsForm. Should come back to this.

This was a temporary implementation. @yanniboi's changes handle removing this method and transition to the queue worker.

As above

It's used to create an explicit transaction for the removal process. I think this should stay.

Looks like this comment is copy/paste from `EntityTraversalContainerInjectionInterface`. Can it be updated to be specific to this task? 

Can we assign this to a variable before returning it? That way we can add a `/* @var */` comment to help the IDE when performing a find usages. 

Can we reword this? Maybe ""Creates an instance of the traversal for this specific entity"" would be better.

Remove reference to `handleEntity` as it doesn't exist within this interface (or add a note that it should be implemented in inheritors of `EntityTraversal`)

Do we want this check here? This means you can't ever call `traverse` twice on the same entity. If there is ever a situation where you want to traverse, then modify the entity based on results, then traverse again then that won't work. 

Should we just hard-code an array of known keys for now? 

👍 That's a much better place for this.

Can we use `$field->getType() == 'entity_reference'` instead of `$entity->{$field_id} instanceof EntityReferenceFieldItemList` for consistency with the other traversal classes?

Can we use `$field->getType() == 'entity_reference'` instead of `$entity->{$field_id} instanceof EntityReferenceFieldItemList` for consistency with the other traversal classes?

Is there a reason to use `->getString()` rather than `->view()` here? Or will that cause problems if it returns markup?

I like the updated traversal!

The function doc block `@return` statement should deal with that, but sure if it helps.

I'm not sure we want multiple traversals. If we did we could provide a default `$force = FALSE` parameter. @andrewbelcher ?

@andrewbelcher ?

Is that going to work? I think getType will return 'file' or 'image' etc depending on what type of field it is, even though they are both entity reference fields...

Yup. `view()` returns a render array and could be anything. `getString()` is safe. We probably will want to extend it at some point to have the ability to alter values, but its a good starting point.

Hmm, I thought it returned entity_reference when I was testing this before. I might be wrong though 😅 

I think if you want to re-do it you can instantiate a new traverser - all the getter methods call `$this->traverse()` to ensure the data has been processed.

I think a hardcoded set of keys is fine. From memory, I would suggest:

- `id`
- `uuid`
- `revision`
- `bundle`
- `language`
- `status`?
- `uid`?

Thinks of any others that are mega important?

Good question. I just gave it a try. It replaces the existing PR with a new commit containing all changes. Which is excellent

Correct. The changed version file is the trigger to create a new tag and release. So when doing a manual hotfix release, you can cherry-pick a commit or manually push a commit and only then change the VERSION file in an additional commit to trigger the build.

nit: `int` is not a JS type; in JS it's just called `number`

nit: `i += numRows` is easier to read

same thing with the `int`

local variables should be `camelCase`

maybe call this `HeatMapRow` instead? `HeatRow` sounds awkward

This loop would be clearer like this:
```javascript
for (const hotIndex of arr) {
  binaryArr[hotIndex] = 1;
}
```

Why did you declare `row` outside of the loop if you don't use it anywhere else? You could just `heatMapValues.push(new HeatMapRow(...))`

nit: since you know this is something that needs to change in the future, you should use an official TODO comment like

`// TODO: retrieve data from the backend instead of using a hardcoded value`

nit: this comment isn't needed, it just explains the implementation below rather than the code's intentions. the code is easy enough to follow without further explanation.

add a comment explaining why you need to reverse the final result

nit: using terms like xth are difficult to follow. Say something closer to ""list of day indices where music was played""

This comment is difficult to parse. It sounds like this is an array of binary values (versus a binary tree being stored in an array, which is what I expect a ""binary array"" to be). If this is the case, store booleans instead where you can be more clear:
```
const likedMusicHist = markMusicDays(LIKED_MUSIC_HIST, TOTAL_LIKED);
```

as mentioned above, just set this value to `true` instead of giving it a number.

This describes the type but not what ""data"" is. Instead elaborate that data is the list of days in which music was listened to.

This is unnecessary since you can just get this info from `data.length`

Good declarative comment.

I don't want to store booleans because the chart can only render integer values (what I have) not boolean values

this is only cause dataLength is a hard coded value from the backend

Then leave a comment detailing this. Otherwise it's odd that you're representing a boolean values as a list of numbers. Something like:
```
// The histogram library takes a list of numbers so that heavier music
// days are displayed as darker. We don't want this gradient, so a day with
// any amount of music will be stored as a `1`.
```

It's still unnecessary. You already use `dataLength` when creating the `data` array so you should instead use `data.length`. This also reduces the surface area of your API, making it easier to use and extend.

Resolving per previous comment thread.

This comment is hard to follow and is essentially just verbalizing the code rather than explaining it. Say something like `Array of 1's and 0's where all indices provided in ""arr"" are set to 1`

make this variable more descriptive. Something like `indicesToFlag`

This function name is vague and just tells us about our data type. Given that you already use terms like `heatIndex` in your function body, you can make the name more specific (like `constructHeatMapSource`) even though the function itself is more general than this.

nit: name this TOTAL_LIKED_VIDEOS

So, I haven't found how OIDC does that then, but how does the server then know, when to throw away encryption keys, if there are no client sessions you can terminate? And if there are such sessions, wouldn't it make more sense to link the txn id to a ""session concept"" instead of device ids, which can be reused?

There are two parts to this in the [OIDC proposal](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861):

1. The client generates their own device ID and specifies it in the OIDC scope that is requested at the point of sign in. This scope described in [MSC2967](https://github.com/sandhose/matrix-doc/blob/msc/sandhose/api-scopes/proposals/2967-api-scopes.md#device-id-handling)
2. When the client signs out the OpenID Provider is responsible for informing the Homeserver that the device should be deleted. This process is described in [MSC2964](https://github.com/sandhose/matrix-doc/blob/msc/sandhose/oauth2-profile/proposals/2964-oauth2-profile.md#logging-out)

I'm somewhat struggling to follow this explanation. I think an example of how it might happen in practice is illustrative:

```suggestion
A device ID could have multiple sequences of access tokens associated
with it (since device ID can be specified as a parameter to 
[`/login`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3login)). 

For example, a ""bot"" implementation might masquerade as the same ""device"" despite
calling `/login` on every run by passing the same device ID. Such a device might
also use the same transaction ID on each run.
```

the opposite, no?

```suggestion
Therefore it could potentially lead to a request being treated as a duplicate
where previously it would have been treated as a distinct request.
```

```suggestion
However, some evidence has been collated which suggests that nothing would be impacted
in reality:
```

```suggestion
#### 1. Data from the matrix.org homeserver suggests the change would have no impact
```

```suggestion
The `matrix.org` homeserver is a reasonable size deployment and could be considered
reasonably representative of the diversity of Matrix clients.
```

```suggestion
Synapse maintains a `event_txn_id` table
that contains a rolling 24 hour window of
(`user_id`, `token_id`, `room_id`, `txn_id`) tuples.
```

```suggestion
This suggests that the widening of the scope from token to device would not have caused
any issues during the periods sampled.
```

You are quite right 👍

@turt2live I think you are the most likely person on the SCT to have concerns over this approach - could you have a look?

I'm failing to parse this sentence.  I think some words may have snuck in during editing.  Maybe you mean

?

```suggestion

```

@uhoreg you are not the only one. I attempted to re-read this morning and couldn't make sense of it either!

I've reworked it into something that hopefully reads better.

The letter of the process and spec would indeed make this a breaking change, though honestly given the data and my own inclination that it'd be fine, I don't mind counting it as backwards compatible for spec purposes.

As someone with very little context on what triggered this MSC to be proposed, I find it quite difficult to figure out the problem it's trying to solve just from reading the MSC's introduction. The ""Do nothing"" part of the Alternatives section has a bit to say about that, but I think it would be helpful to also have this information here, so by the time the reader gets to the proposal it's clear what problem it's trying to solve.

I've had a re-read and I agree. I've added some more info in the intro section to try and make it clearer sooner: [`6fc4975`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3970/commits/6fc4975c52ec3ed72b9234aa01c81551850c840d)

OK, so we slightly inflate (by one pointer) the size of `OSDCap` and `MonCap`. I think it's worth doing that but I assumed neither of types has tons of instances.

`cct` is initialized to `nullptr` in `MDSAuthCaps.h`. So I was skipping assignment. But, yeah, it's unnecessary.

If we're going to use `g_ceph_context` (a global variable), why bother storing it in the cap structure?

i'm not sure whether we should help users uppercase, especially with @passamo9's [thumbs up on small-cased titles](https://github.com/passamo9/LaTeX_EnglandWales_Templates/pull/31#discussion_r579626859). plus `\underline` does not work well with multiline `\MakeUppercase`s, altho that probably won't matter to section headings.

- `\@title` should be `$1`. 
- maybe not `\MakeUppercase` as mentioned in another thread?

what does

> element is not centred, or bolded

refer to?

can we add a TODO for cleaning up the magic numbers? probably with optional args.

Nit: looks like we are using the comment style `% Capitalized sentence without period` thruout the project. let's change `remove` to `Remove` here to be consistent.

use `\newlist` as mentioned [here](https://github.com/passamo9/LaTeX_EnglandWales_Templates/pull/10#issuecomment-778842367)?

remove.

hmm i can't comment on L21 since there's no change there. that's dumb.

do we want to add `\signature` after L21, to be consistent with `opinion.tex`?

file `engwales-legal.cls` doesn't exist.

Nit: space before `%`.

what's the benefit of using KOMA-Script? (maybe start an issue if this is going to be a lengthy discussion.)

Nit: probably want these grouped so remove blank line here.

what happens (or _should_ happen) if non were selected?

do we want to implement our own version of spaced out boxes then? if that's the idea change this to TODO?

provides better underlines (`\uline`).

i used 2.5 cm because the example Particulars of Claim doc used 2.5 cm. but i was curious if that's required too. @passamo9 is a margin of 2.5 cm required or just your preference?

note that this is [different](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/378578/233897) than 1.5 spacing in Word tho. this is closer to double spacing in Word. @passamo9 is Word 1.5 line spacing required?

Yea, it's up to everyone else. I'm aware it's a bit much for most but I really like readability.

ah no i'm not saying get rid of all of this. i too like separators. i just think this is a bit too much. (e.g., one empty line + one separator might be enough.)

I don't know... I was having some issues with it playing nice unless it was marked as false by default. I presume it doesn't load a specific format so you just get an article without many frills, and no reworked title. If @passamo9, or someone else thinks one should be a default then we can work that in.

or require at least one of the options to be set. at that point maybe `type=opinion` than individual options?

I couldn't see why we needed spaced out boxes to begin with. Though I'll see if I can find a different solution.

opps, that's a typo, meant to be 1.3.

it's used in `\so{BETWEEN}`. of course worst scenario we could just hard code the BETWEEN text if that's the only place where this is needed. in any case i think we can resolve this in other PRs?

i find `\onehalfspacing` more appealing but again that's different than Word's 1.5 spacing, so i'm not sure if it's allowed.

Hmm? This is the exact same as it was before. What are you referring to here?

Yeah, I just kept it the same from what it was. I made it uppercase to mimic how INTRODUCTION and FACTS are written, but I do agree with your points, though multi-line sections are probably not a worry, but we'll see what passamo9 says.

Easy enough to change. Give me a jiffy.

changed

Is there a way to do this without reverting a commit?

Yeah, that's why I left the todo to remind me for a later PR. I'm going to resolve this then.

From the [link](https://www.civillitigationbrief.com/2017/11/05/fonts-lawyers-and-the-rules-never-ever-use-comic-sans/) @passamo9 sent in #29, it doesn't look like there is any rigid regulation, but merely preferred practice. So, I doubt that there'd be any penalty due to the word vs latex 1.5 line spacing difference.

The tramlined element. It is merely a reminder that if you are using it, you have to centre, or bold it yourself.

Ahh, I didn't catch those. They were copied over. Just for clarity my comment style (in latex) is `%% Capitol, sans period` for permanent comments, and `% anything` for impermanent comments and todos. If we want to change the style to something else, that's fine with me.

There wasn't a signature mark in the pleading sample so I didn't add the mechanics for the pleading style or tex. Perhaps @passamo9 can indicate what's necessary.

Okay, I'll update it.

Fixed.

Fixed.

Fixed

Fixed, somewhat... Still a bit spaced out.

Right you are about the `\@title`. Fixed it. And @passamo9, do titles need to be fully capitalised (no small caps)? If not I'll remove the uppercase, if so, probably best to keep it in just in case.

Fixed.

sorry i meant L12. on L12 we have

```tex
\renewcommand\maketitle{%
  ...
}
```

and here we have

```tex
\newcommand{\signature}
{
  ...
}
```

which are inconsistent in style. i think we can keep the braces around the command name `{\maketitle}`. you can pick whether the open bracket goes on the same or next line.

probably not. nvm then.

ah i see. we definitely don't want to bold for the user, but should we center for the user then?

i think it's fine to leave that to the user? of course unless we want to be able to later refer to the title in title case instead of all caps. but whatever we do, we should either `\MakeUppercase` in all places or none.

s/Engwales-legal/ewlegal/

this part is the same as in ewlegal-opinion. extract to .cls for now.

do we really want to provide shortcuts like these? feels unnecessary. and it's a learning overhead to the user if they want to use the cls as intended. if we do this, we should make sure to provide almost all possible sections that can be in an opinion.

Ah, okay. Was confused there. I have a fondness for:

```latex
\acommand{option}
{
  multi-line option
}
```

I can go change it to that in a bit.

I was trying to reduce the limitations of using the element in ways we aren't dictating. As it gets wrapped in centers for the titles anyways, I thought it doesn't need it.

Fixed.

Okay, I'll resolve this then.

this is not marked as TODO tho?

haven't used A4 paper before. TIL.

> Still a bit spaced out

what do you mean?

yeah i think leaving that to the user is good. closing.

I added them originally as more a demonstration of potential for @passamo9. The fact you can define and call arbitrary amounts of code like this. 

Removed.

I don't believe @passamo9 has given clear indication on what header/footer elements should exist so I separated them in case they were different. If @passamo9 could indicate if there is any difference in the headers and footers depending on document type, that'd be useful for correct placement.

Added one there.

I added a brief todo.

There was some space around them, but not between, but they should be okay now. Resolving for now.

I think I caught them all, everything that is multiline should be in the form:

```latex
\acommand{option}
{
  multi-line option
}
```

Fixed.

we probably don't need the `%` here. i just like to throw one after open brackets. might as well remove all / add it to all since we are unifying the style.

`%` after `\court` is unnecessary (i think?)

remove?

Fixed.

I've got no issues with having

```latex
\command
{%
  Multi-line
}
```

as a style. I updated them all (I think) to follow that style.

Fixed.

> Please note that writing to $_ENV does not actually set an environment variable, i.e. the variable will not propagate to any child processes you launch (except forked script processes, in which case it's just a variable in the script's memory). To set real environment variables, you must use putenv().

However, in https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.putenv.php the first comment states:

> putenv/getenv, $_ENV, and phpinfo(INFO_ENVIRONMENT) are three completely distinct environment stores. doing putenv(""x=y"") does not affect $_ENV; but also doing $_ENV[""x""]=""y"" likewise does not affect getenv(""x"").

So I'm wondering whether we should just go with `new Dotenv(true);` to keep the current behavior.

I think I found the issue, `getenv` and `putenv` are not thread safe, this why the got eliminated by `dotenv`. The issue is that the test env loader is not loading custom params. I trying to fix this 

@escopecz this is the suggested solution, waiting for test results

I reverted to use `getenv` and putenv`, my solution did not work as expected.

`pathCache.containsKey(targetUri)` can be true even when `pathConfig == null` because even cases when path config wasn't found (`matches` does same check, `org.keycloak.adapters.authorization.PathCache#put`). Just by reading code, I guess this situation may happen when even any path config isn't matched (that's what code allows, not sure if application logic too).

Therefore this condition can be useful to avoid matching when we already know it won't be successful.

What if I want to pass csrf token only in header, not in header and cookie?

Returning only the cookies might be good as an optional setting. Seems like returning the tokens in the response data implies that the API trusts that an SPA will do the right thing. There are lots of examples and tutorials out there that parse the data and store the tokens in localStorage.
P.S., thanks for this work!

Thanks for your work. I have been following the readme and using this in a react/next js app. I am having trouble getting the cookie-jar to work in the browser. It works when I make curl request but when I do axios call in the browser I am unable to get the csrf token because cookie-jar does not work. It may be related to the security in the browser. Is it possible to have an option to return the csrf token in the data field of the response?

Is it possible not to have a dependency on urls routes being named 'token_refresh' ? I am trying to use this code with djoser which depends on simplejwt, and djoser names the routes differently (https://github.com/sunscrapers/djoser/blob/master/djoser/urls/jwt.py). Maybe this is something the djoser maintainers should change. If it is not possible to change here, I can ask the djoser maintainers to change the url route names consistent with what you have here. 

I have confirmed that cookie-jar does not work in browser (https://github.com/3846masa/axios-cookiejar-support/issues/247) so SPA may not be able to use it.

cookie-jar is the engine used to write cookies to a given file after a request in curl only, so it doesn't have anything to do with your browser's cookie engine.

thanks for your response. Any idea how I can get the csrftoken value in the browser then because the documentation says ""Copy csrftoken cookie value from cookies.txt file to X-CSRFToken header"", and then use it has a header to access a protected view ?

I haven't tried this yet myself, but I think it's just a matter of telling axios the name of the cookie and the header:

```
axios.defaults.xsrfCookieName = 'csrftoken';
axios.defaults.xsrfHeaderName = 'X-CSRFTOKEN';
```
or

```
const api = axios.create({
  xsrfCookieName: 'csrftoken',                                                                                                                                        
  xsrfHeaderName: 'X-CSRFTOKEN',                                                                                                                                      
});

When I use fetch in the client to make the request, I don't see a cookie created in my browser.

If you are trying to retrieve it using js. The entire point of httponly cookies is not being able to
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HttpOnly

The http only cookies are getting sent because I can see it in the response header but it is not getting saved in the browser when I am checking developer tools.

Although I cannot access the cookies using JS, the browser developer tools should still display it, if it is saved (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17508027/cant-access-cookies-from-document-cookie-in-js-but-browser-shows-cookies-exist). 



I think it is similar problem to this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22432616/why-is-the-browser-not-setting-cookies-after-an-ajax-request-returns 

But that solution is not working in my case.

Calling Axios with withCredential option set to true saves the authorization and csrf cookies in the browser.

But the refresh cookie is not getting saved because the response for refresh cookie has Path set to ""/auth/jwt/refresh"" (which is the path I have for refresh token in django url.py routes).

For example, this is the response header with Path variable for refresh cookie:
`Set-Cookie: Authorization_refresh=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoicmVmcmVzaCIsImV4cCI6MTU3ODg4NDk3NSwianRpIjoiYjhmMDU3NWYzMjRhNGJjNGIxMzU5M2I5NGM3NTA2ZDAiLCJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0fQ.ImVyLbnxWNhaQelr06-Z5YmVfB_Hot3R-nXhHq0Qor0; expires=Mon, 13 Jan 2020 03:09:35 GMT; HttpOnly; Max-Age=86400; Path=/auth/jwt/refresh; SameSite=Strict`

The browser does not have that path, so it does not get saved. @NiyazNz  do you know how I can change that path for refresh cookie to be Path=/ like for the other cookies. Also SameSite=Strict could also be a problem. This is similar to what is mentioned here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58588976/axios-is-not-sending-cookies

Compare this to the response for authorization cookie which works fine and has Path=/ :
`Set-Cookie: Authorization=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNTc4Nzk4ODc1LCJqdGkiOiJiYTc2MWNkZDdjYmE0MGE3YjlhZjEyYTJhNGFhYWI1NCIsInVzZXJfaWQiOjR9.--b9gWvJdAgxx9Q6zhjvk-kttmaqlRjsJS0yDjj8RGo; expires=Mon, 13 Jan 2020 03:09:35 GMT; HttpOnly; Max-Age=86400; Path=/; SameSite=Lax`

I wasn't trying to retrieve it using JS, but I realized my problem... I forgot that I had an environment variable set exposing my dev server through ngrok, so that was why it wasn't set as the request was to the wrong domain.

I ran into similar issues getting the cookies to save in the browser and to send back to the server. My development setup is working now, with changes to both Django and Axios settings:

```
# Django CORS config, in settings.py
CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True
from corsheaders.defaults import default_headers
CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS = list(default_headers) + [
    'access-control-allow-origin',
    'access-control-allow-credentials',
]
CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST = [
    # update this list accordingly
    'http://127.0.0.1:8080',
]
```

```
// Axios config for use with axios.create(); can adapt for use with axios.defaults
const options = {
  baseURL: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'http://127.0.0.1:8000',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials': true,
  },
  xsrfCookieName: 'csrftoken',
  xsrfHeaderName: 'X-CSRFTOKEN',
  withCredentials: true,
};
```

Note that my API dev server is on port 8000 and my front-end dev server is on port 8080. As others have mentioned, be sure endpoint URLs with Axios end in a slash `/`.

I also was unable to see the cookie for the refresh token with the Chrome developer tools, but I could see cookies for the csrf and access tokens. The answer to [this SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50369779/cookie-not-being-set-in-browser) suggested that not all saved cookies are visible in the Application/Cookies panel. Sure enough, my requests to `/token/refresh/` worked, and I could see all the correct cookies in headers under the Network panel.
Hope this helps!

That's great ! So, the refresh cookie is stored in the browser even though we cannot see it in the developer tools.

I had a look at the code, and the expiration date for the access and refresh tokens in the cookie is set to the same date. I was expecting the expiration dates to be different.

I am not sure why but the response data is also returning the tokens. The cookie already has the tokens so returning the tokens again with the response data seems to be a security risk. Instead it would help to return just the expiration dates of the tokens, so that a SPA can check for expiration and ask for a new token (if needed).



I see that both *cookies* expire after 24 hours, but when I decode the *payloads* of the access and refresh tokens, they have the correct (default) expiration times of 5 minutes and 24 hours, respectively.

There are a couple comments above about returning the tokens in the response data as well as the cookies. I think it's okay as long as a front-end developer doesn't follow one of the many tutorials out there and puts the token into localStorage, defeating the purpose of httpOnly. It would be nice to have a configurable option that sends only the token's payload in the response data.

I have problem with this line. My url 'token_refresh' located in the namespace 'auth'. Maybe it put in the settings AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE_PATH. Sorry for bad english.

> That's great! So, the refresh cookie is stored in the browser even though we cannot see it in the developer tools.

You can also view the cookies by visiting the domain they are linked too


This line call exception 'This QueryDict instance is immutable'

This is probably a thing to ask silly ask, but isn't the idea behind csrf protection to defend users who have an active session? If we aren't using session authentication, how does csrf improve security?

I think you may use  api_settings.AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESIT constant to set the attribute.

what about the `domain=None` on the creation of `{AUTH_COOKIE}_refresh`?

# Behaviour
On this line the `request.META.['CSRF_COOKIE']` is set from `CSRF_COOKIE`. 

Later on line `csrf_token = request.META.get('CSRF_COOKIE')` it's set on the method `CSRFCheck.process_view()`.

Later `request_csrf_token` is set from  `request.META.get(settings.CSRF_HEADER_NAME, '')` (header `X-CSRFToken`).

After we have these csrf tokens we compare `request_csrf_token` against `csrf_token`.

# Problem?
My `request_csrf_token` is `None` if I don't send the header `X-CSRFToken`. So I need to send the header `X-CSRFToken` from my frontend. To do so my frontend application need to access the CSRF cookie. 

Is this supposed to happen? 

Or should my backend set `request.META.get(settings.CSRF_HEADER_NAME, '')` from `CSRF_COOKIE`?

# Note
When my frontend and backend are running from different servers my frontend doesn't have access to `CSRF_COOKIE` 

Is it necessary to have an empty dict inside the response? Shouldn't it just be `Response()`?

`ugettext_lazy ` deprecated in favor of `gettext_lazy`.

Since you're working with CSRF, you should instead use this Django setting instead of `False`: [CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#csrf-cookie-secure). Same for the rest of the settings. Set the defaults to the CSRF counterparts.

Similarly to the AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE: [CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#csrf-cookie-samesite)

You'll need to merge with master and move this documentation to where the rest of the documentation is now

Hmm, try setting: `CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True`

Is `datetime.now()` the expected behavior? The server could be anywhere, the client can be anywhere, so perhaps using `django.utils.timezone.now` would be better since it will always use UTC server side. The method `set_cookie` expects a datetime object in UTC: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponse.set_cookie

Idk if L124 would be a problem then. 

Again, should probably use `timezone.now()` instead of `datetime.now()`

I feel like this should have a better name, more verbose like `AUTH_COOKIE_NAME` like the `CSRF_COOKIE_NAME`.

`SameSite='strict'` Slightly concerning if a dev creates a subdomain (e.g. Instagram's misc. webpages).

same here use domain.com for the front-end and api.domain.com for the backend. i rather have the cookie in domain.com

Same here, I'd prefer this to not be hardcoded. Current implementation means backend `api.domain.com` and frontend `domain.com` won't work, which a lot of people use.

I would prefer this:
`domain=None` -> `domain=api_settings.AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN`
`samesite='Strict'` -> `domain=api_settings.AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE`

or at least a separate setting for the refresh token so it's configurable.

I think that these changes should be reverted. Read the last comment in https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.environment.php#114811:

> Please note that writing to $_ENV does not actually set an environment variable, i.e. the variable will not propagate to any child processes you launch (except forked script processes, in which case it's just a variable in the script's memory). To set real environment variables, you must use putenv().

However, in https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.putenv.php the first comment states:

> putenv/getenv, $_ENV, and phpinfo(INFO_ENVIRONMENT) are three completely distinct environment stores. doing putenv(""x=y"") does not affect $_ENV; but also doing $_ENV[""x""]=""y"" likewise does not affect getenv(""x"").

So I'm wondering whether we should just go with `new Dotenv(true);` to keep the current behavior.

I think I found the issue, `getenv` and `putenv` are not thread safe, this why the got eliminated by `dotenv`. The issue is that the test env loader is not loading custom params. I trying to fix this 

@escopecz this is the suggested solution, waiting for test results

I reverted to use `getenv` and putenv`, my solution did not work as expected.

I noticed that the span object will end up with status 0 (=OK) in case of an exception. I added `span.set_status(Status.from_exception(exception))` to ensure that downstream systems treat this as an error.

Question is if the http status code should also be set?

The stack trace is also collected differently in the Flask extension: https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-python/blob/master/contrib/opencensus-ext-flask/opencensus/ext/flask/flask_middleware.py#L223-L229 

I believe this is the reason why I don't see the stack trace in the proper place in Azure Application Insights. The actual ""stack_trace"" attribute is empty.

The implementation here via span attributes is actually correct. `opencensus-ext-azure` (which sends data to Azure App insights) extracts stack trace from span attributes and not `strack_trace` attribute property.

Agree with @calleo  that span `status` should be set on exception.

Thanks for pointing that out. I think I've found a bug in the azure exporter which I have reported here: https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-python/pull/1187

I believe it would be good to set the http status code as well (to 500), as that's what's going to happen if we end-up in `_handle_exception`. Makes it easier to search through these logs and setup alert conditions.

@calleo  Left a couple of comments on your pr. Good find.

To be honest, I don't really understand the point here, although it seems odd that hostnames is there but paths is not. Should I remove it?

I'm assuming the original intention was to have the exclude list as a global list of hostnames to not track (across integrations) which is why it's being stored in the local context. Doesn't seem like that feature is implemented though. The way you have it now is fine :)

For the `POST /_matrix/client/v3/keys/device_signing/upload` endpoint, the Homeserver should only require User-Interactive

input? If this is the case then the existing Synapse behaviour of allowing a UIA grace period is probably also non-compliant.
```

```suggestion
Not applicable as client behaviour need not change.
```

I've applied this and made some more tweaks. Thank you.

in theory, yes. And yes, synapse is non-compliant. The idea is that making a request without an `auth` property is a way to find out what authentication is required.

Could we mandate that clients hoping to take advantage of this exemption proactively supply an `m.login.dummy` auth dict?

Okay. I've made https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/15166 about the Synapse compliance. I don't think it needs to impact this MSC so I will update this section.

Also chances are the user has just entered their password on the registration form, so they'll likely remember it anyhow.

A possible security issue around this is accounts which are ancient (created more than an hour in the past) and under control of an attacker: they could use the user's existing non-encrypted reputation to potentially get people to trust a new master key. However, this is adequately covered by the ""should"" in the proposal - the homeserver can decide it's been too long and enact UIA.

Yes, there could indeed be scenarios where the homeserver admin wishes to implement some alternative logic depending on the account/user state or other policy.

This could be clarified in the actual spec changes such that a client should be prepared to complete UIA even if it is the first time keys are being uploaded.

I think we probably need to be more explicit about what, exactly, we mean by ""not requiring UIA"".

Should the client submit the request with no `auth` dict at all, changing the part of the spec that says

> A request to an endpoint that uses User-Interactive Authentication never succeeds without auth.

?

Or does the client make a request with an ` m.login.dummy` auth type?

I think this is unquestionably a good idea and is entirely sensible, but I'm also not sure you need an MSC for this? I think it depends on the 'should' in this sentence. If it were a 'must', clients could rely on any server claiming to support a recent enough version of the spec allowing this request without auth. If it's just a recommended behaviour, aren't servers free to just allow the request with no auth? (Although also rich's comment below about being more specific about no auth dict vs `m.login.dummy`). That said, an MSC to set intentions could still be useful, but there may be no need for this to block you.

It's hard to tell from the spec, but I think we do actually require an MSC to at least make the intention clear. What ""should"" actually equates to, as has been pointed out, is a question, though the actual behaviour of whether it's legal to return no flows, etc is undetermined at present. This MSC would codify that.

Why does it return the count? The method that calls this method can do the count on the array too, right?

Also, I'm a bit afraid doing select queries without any limit. Check other timeline implementations. They use `trait TimelineTrait::getTimelineResults()` to build the filtering.

Hi @escopecz,
paging these events did not work. I fixed this.

The PHP engine was removed from the 5.x branch. Please use html.twig files only. But in this case I wonder if we can omit the template completely when it's empty.

Be careful with queries like this as searching with wildcards from the beginning is expensive as it cannot use indexes. So if the table grows into hundreds of thousands then searching will become unusable as it will time out the request and cause issues for the users. In many places we use only wildcard at the end of the string.

Also, does it make sense to search in the type? It's already handled above. But why the ""like"" operator was used there?

I deleted this template.

Hi @escopecz, 
In the timeline search, page hits are also searched in this way. 
```
        // app/bundles/PageBundle/Entity/HitRepository.php  
        // Line: 86
        $query->andWhere($query->expr()->like('p.title', $query->expr()->literal('%'.$options['search'].'%')));        
```
e.g. 

without a wildcard from the beginning, there will be no focus named ""[DPMMA-1743] focus test"" in the result:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100592709/229822137-928d84ea-4866-4a2f-a202-a51891fa20ca.png)

A type search makes sense when its search phrase ""click"" or ""view"":

but It doesn't sense with ""like"" operator. I Changed this. 

In conclusion you are right that searching with wildcard is expensive. However, removing the wildcard from the beginning will limit the search possibilities. I leave the final decision in this matter to you :).


```suggestion
     * @var ?Lead
```
When you create a fresh entity then this is null. 
```php
$stat = new Stat();
$stat->getLead(); // returns null, not Lead
```

I thought you wrote that you've changed the `like` into `eq` but it's still there. [I've read](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/543580/equals-vs-like) that `like` is 300 times slower compared to `eq`. It will differ based on the amount of data in the table, but still. Why not make it faster?
```suggestion
            $q->expr()->eq('s.type', ':type');
```
And somewhere bellow you'll set the param:
```php
$q->setParameter('type', $type);
```

Same here. Why use `like` over `eq`?

I'm afraid I can't let this be merged. We've done this mistake many times and it resulted in angry customers that cannot load a page when they start searching. If I wouldn't learn from past mistakes then what good am I?

To make a compromise between usablity and performance, change this to
```suggestion
                $q->expr()->like('f.name', $q->expr()->literal($options['search'].'%')),
                $q->expr()->like('f.description', $q->expr()->literal($options['search'].'%')),
```
And add indexes on the `Stat` entity on these 2 columns + migration for existing Mautic instances adding those indexes.

I changed this.

I changed this.

I changed it for search in 's.type'. I leave 'like' for wildcard searches.

No problemo :) 
I changed the wildcard for 'f.name' and removed the 'f.description' search. 
I added the index and migration 'f.name'

However, since the variable should store uniform objects, I think using an array makes more sense and will e.g. remove the need to deconstruct the string and reconstruct it later in `endPlayedSegment` and `getProgress`. You have more flexibility this way. When you finally need the string for output, you can just join the array elements (in a separate function), but using an array for storing you could e.g. now easily filter for segments of particular length, sort them, etc. if that's needed later (you sort them in `getProgress`).

The same is true for each segment itself, which contains a startTime and an endTime. You could make the code easier by storing a segment as an object such as `{start: x, end: y}` (which would even describe what you're looking at) or as an array `[x, y]`. You will not have to constantly convert from strings to arrays or numbers and back. Instead, just turn the segment in the final string form of s.xxx[.]s.xxx  when you need it.

There's a missing space between = and 0.

There are several variables like this that are defined, but not used (yet?). Does it make sense to leave them in the code for later options, or could they be added when actually needed?

If missing, quality will be set to either the width or the height of the video. The video CoP isn't clear about this, but it seems to prefer the video height as an indicator of quality, e.g. 720, 1080.

It's not clear whether `width` and `height` are mandatory parameters, but since you compare `width` against being undefined, they might be considered optional or not necessarily set explicitly. In this case, `height` might be undefined or an empty string, possibly leading to something as ""1920x"" for the `playbackSize`.

`Document.fullscreen` is marked as obsolete, cmp. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/fullscreen. The variable state might be renamed to `fullscreen` or `isFullscreen`.

There are extension prefixes/id prefixes that are often used, e.g. 'https://w3id.org/xapi/video'. I think it makes sense to put them in constants and then concatenate them with the parameter when needed.

It seems that the state/value of `seekStart` is not read anywhere outside of `getArgsXAPISeeked`. Is it necessary to use it globally?

Please check if `toFixed(2)` is necessary here. It's not used in similar occurrences of `endPlayedSegment`.

There's quite some duplicate code shared by the following 'interacted' statements.
Could there be a wrapping function such as `getArgsXAPIInteracted`? This would remove some redundancies, especially if other interacted statements might be added later.

The ""terminated"" interactions seems to be missing, cmp. video CoP. It is optional, but I see no reason why the video library should not offer it to completely mirror the CoP.

There doesn't seem to be a need to introduce `isMuted`. Also, `volumeChange` sounds rather like a delta to me. Why not simply call it `volume`? Together with the previous hint, it could simply be

    volume = muted ? 0 : formatFloat(volume);

`getProgress` seems to do what it is intended to do, but it could be much easier if you didn't use a string to store the segments, and the code could be more intelligible if you used e.g. `Array.prototype.map` (might work what you called normalizing) and `Array.prototype.reduce` for computing progressLength.
- map: https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
- reduce: https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce

This might be a matter of taste, but I prefer explicit casting with `parseInt` over something like `1 * string_with_number_inside`.

You don't need to introduce `arr` here. You could just concatenate a new segment to `playedSegments` if necessary.
    playedSegments += (playedSegments.length === 0) ? '' : '[,]';
    playedSegments += formatFloat(playedSegmentsSegmentStart) + '[.]' + formatFloat(endTime);
However, see my comment about using an array instead of a string for `playedSegments`. In that case, you could simply
push the new segment to the array.

I have not yet checked the changes to the players, but since playing the video backwards shouldn't count: Do you need to take the absolute value of `endTime` and `playedSegmentStart`?

`endTime !== playedSegmentsSegmentStart` is redundant. If they were the same, then `Math.abs(endTime - playedSegmentsSegmentStart)` would be 0 resulting in `Math.abs(endTime - playedSegmentsSegmentStart) > 1` to be false.

You could use `H5P.createUUID()` instead, see https://h5p.org/documentation/api/H5P.html#.createUUID

`formatFloat` doesn't do want you want it to do, because you are casting the string back to a number in the return statement Also, the video CoP seems to suggest to measure even milliseconds. Although H5P doesn't deliver the information that precisely, I think it wouldn't harm to to use `toFixed(3)`

`secondsTiISO8601Duration` does not work as intended. It doesn't return a string defined by the ISO8601 standard. The unit specific segments are returned as absolute totals, not as the ""remainders"".

For example, the input value of 8192 (seconds) should return PT2H16M32S for 2 hours, 16 minutes and 32 seconds, but it returns PT2H136M8192S.

Also, there are some missing semicolons, time is already defined, and I am not sure why `hasOwnProperty()`` is necessary if you're looping over the properties that you just defined yourself?

I can't reproduce your comment on `secondsToISO8601Duration()`; calling `secondsToISO8601Duration(8192)` returns a value of `""PT2H16M32S""`, not sure where your value came from.

Agreed on `hasOwnProperty()`.

@jhaag75 can you weigh in here?

Awesome, thanks!

This was pulled from @jhaag75's reference implementation, so I'll let Jason weigh in first to make sure we're not missing anything by changing this.
https://github.com/jhaag75/xapi-videojs/blob/master/xapi-videojs.js#L37-L44

`parseInt()` fails spectacularly with very small or very large numbers, so you may want to rethink your preference: https://schier.co/blog/2012/12/22/parseint-fails-on-small-numbers.html

In this case, if `progressLength` is very small (user pauses right after the video starts), and the video `duration` is long (say 3 hour video), we can get an invalid `progress` value. Paste this into your console to see what I mean:
`1 * parseInt(0.01 / 10800);`

Let's pass this suggestion by @jhaag75 first, since it is from his reference implementation:
https://github.com/jhaag75/xapi-videojs/blob/master/xapi-videojs.js#L51-L91


Fixed. https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/735bf0995d2d37995a9ce1aa44f709518317024f

That's correct that the CoP intends the value to describe height. I will clarify that in the documentation.

Doesn't look like it's necessary, good catch! https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/745ab2ab4bd7f42f99d3bdc5ba24cf02d1332548

I mean, it's a URL, is it worth refactoring out common components? Should we have a constant for `https://` as well? I think it reads easier keeping the URLs as complete strings, instead of concatenated pieces.

Agreed: https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/44a36df1e9e84589bd9a2a4cfe6fd758043237aa

I think `playedSegmentsSegmentEnd` can be removed, but first let me verify the logic here is working correctly. @KirkJohnson can you check on this here: https://github.com/uhm-coe/h5p-video/blob/master/scripts/x-api.js#L57,L61

I read that as `playedSegmentsSegmentStart` gets set to `currentTime`, and then the value pushed onto the array ends up being `currentTime [.] currentTime`

Looks like that `self.playedSegmentsSegmentStart = currentTime;` line was added in this commit here: https://github.com/uhm-coe/h5p-video/commit/f82c2cbbe44018f5425d925726214908e06a55dc

Fixed https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/c9a68cfc73401eb2ccb8c7b86fa5cf1028eed1b3

Sorry, I'm not sure what went wrong on my end. I can confirm that you're absolutely right about `secondsToISO8601Duration()`.

Sure! Good idea.

Maybe it is done intentionally or I simply don't get the idea behind it. I was comparing the output with the played segments usage example at https://github.com/liveaspankaj/xapi-video-cop/blob/master/statement_data_model.md. It seems to always include all the milliseconds, so in my understanding, something like formatFloat(2.1) should not return 2.1 but 2.100 -- which would, of course, need to remain a string and be fine if you don't use the return value for computation.

I just learned that I should put more of my thoughts into review comments. Thanks!

Point taken! I wasn't aware of that, thx! Could you then just add a one-line comment on that issue, please?

Got it, see here: https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/cb1b90ebcb635b3113b9164293d55ac9ed3af852

I don't think you're missing anything. Pankaj wrote that. I'll see if I can ping him for comment.

@liveaspankaj

Thanks for diving into this one. After reviewing the spec with the Video Profile community, we decided to use 3-decimal precision everywhere we can (the spec typically says to store ""Float Value with maximum 3 decimals"").
Example: https://liveaspankaj.gitbooks.io/xapi-video-profile/content/statement_data_model.html#2543-time-to 

I cleaned things up throughout the codebase to use `formatFloat()` which always does `.toFixed(3)` in order to standardize on 3-decimal precision: https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/0ef32d9a17e16209379089338ff4dec4f9c8aec7

FYI I refactored this bit, so now it just uses `formatFloat()` which will use a standard 3-decimal precision: https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/0ef32d9a17e16209379089338ff4dec4f9c8aec7

I like it, thanks! https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/f210eba346c48a50e0379665ff0a920db9ae17f2

Re: `interacted`, I think I'd prefer to leave it, just because all the different types of interactions have such different `extension` values. I could refactor out the common components into a private function called `getArgsXAPIInteracted()`, but then I'd be splitting up the xAPI functions between public and private, and all the JSON data wouldn't be together, etc.

Maybe reevaluate in the future if additional interactions get implemented?

Thanks, I clarified decimal precision here: https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/0ef32d9a17e16209379089338ff4dec4f9c8aec7
I verified that it is consistent.

I refactored `getProgress()`, `endPlayedSegment()`, and `playedSegments` from Jason's reference implementation here: https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/a00b8b5a25a5f38f372508836d413ff8d5e765c5

Logic should be much clearer now.

Kirk fixed this redundancy here: https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/ca9a1966c943baadca5c515d6ab9691ae23c85c1

Refactored to use `map()` and `reduce()` here: https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/a00b8b5a25a5f38f372508836d413ff8d5e765c5

Refactored here: https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/a00b8b5a25a5f38f372508836d413ff8d5e765c5

`quality` now defaults to `height` if it isn't provided: https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/af8e98571eaae8741f605fa1faa628599ddcb9c1

 `width` is a required param, but since it comes from `video.videoWidth` (html5) or `player.getPlaybackQuality()` (youtube), we can't completely rely on it having a meaningful value. The check is just to mark invalid (or unreported) video sizes.

I think this looks much cleaner, thanks!

I will change this later myself if you don't have the time, but if you cannot work with a reference to an array, you can also clone slice() which might be easier and quicker than going for JSON parsing.

`var parsedPlayedSegments = playedSegments.slice();`

**suggestion**
I have consulted with a colleague on this one. He agrees with me that the code for triggering the xAPI should be inside _video.js_ and not within the handler.

There already is a listener for 'loaded', and you could put this code block there, then there's no need to have this code in every handler (for now _html5.js_ and _youtube.js_).

**suggestion**
As mentioned in the previews review comments, there's the same pattern in all the previous functions and they are identical to a large degree. One way to make the code more compact would be to use something to wrap it all like

    /**
     * Generates 'seeked' xAPI statement (Video Profile).

     * @param {number} currentTime - Time of the video currently.
     * @param {Object} params - Parameters.
     * @param {string} params.verb - Verb for the xAPI statement.
     * @param {Object} [params.result] - Extensions for the object.
     * @param {Object} [params.extensionsContext] - Extensions for the context.
     * @return {Object} JSON xAPI statement
     */
    self.getArgsXAPI = function (currentTime, params) {
      params.extensionsObject = params.extensionsObject || {};
      params.extensionsContext = params.extensionsContext || {};

      var dateTime = new Date();
      var timeStamp = dateTime.toISOString();

      return {
        'verb': {
          'id': 'http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/' + params.verb,
          'display': {'en-US': params.verb}
        },
        'object': getXAPIObject(),
        'result': params.result,
        'context': {
          'contextActivities': {'category': [{'id': 'https://w3id.org/xapi/video'}]},
          'extensions': params.extensionsContext
        },
        'timestamp' : timeStamp
      };
    };

and then the individual trigger functions could remain something like

    self.getArgsXAPIPlayed = function (currentTime) {
      var resultExtTime = formatFloat(currentTime);
      playingSegmentStart = resultExtTime;

      return self.getArgsXAPI(currentTime, {
        verb: 'played',
        result: {extensions: {'https://w3id.org/xapi/video/extensions/time': resultExtTime}},
        extensionsObject: {'https://w3id.org/xapi/video/extensions/session-id': sessionID}
      });
    };

Alternatively, you could also work with several smaller functions that add a particular field's contents like it has been done in some other occasions with xAPI. For example something that works like:
    xapiEvent.setExtensions(context, {'full-screen': isFullscreen', 'screen-size': screenSize});

**bug**
This functions leads to a crash when I want to edit a video. I have not traced it back completely, but I guess that the initialization fails for a newly created or edited video instance that doesn't have all the parameters set yet.

On creating a new video, when I added a video resource and click on added interaction, I got
`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'definition' of undefined at getXAPIObject` in line 509.

On editing an existing video, when clicking on added interaction, I got
`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'url' of undefined` at H5P.XAPIEvent.getContentXAPIId that traces back to line 504.

Could you please check if you can reproduce this problem?

I think the cleanest way would be to check if `editor` is set in IV and then don't do xAPI stuff at all (there's no need to trigger for authors), but it might be tricky to get to that variable. Since it works fine if you're not editing, there's probably something in the instance variable that you're using as a constructor parameter that's different if you're editing.

**suggestion**
Also, this function is called quite often, but it will always return the same result. You could call it once on initialization and store the return value in a variable that you can call.

**suggestion**
See HTML5.js comment.

**discussion**
This works nicely. In some of my test runs, I however got a progress like `0.999` and `finished` wasn't triggered. I also noticed that sometime (but not always), when you pause a video for the first time, the segment says it started at 0.01 instead of 0. Could be related.

I have not yet looked in to this, and this may well be a problem in H5P, but maybe you have an idea since you worked with the video library lately?

**discussion**
This may not an issue, but I'd like to check on that anyway. Maybe @jmkevan can consult here?

The way H5P works, it triggers a `paused` event whenever the user starts seeking in order to stop playing the video. This now also triggers a `paused` xAPI statement before a `seeked` xAPI statement.

I guess that's okay, since the description of the `paused` verb reads ""Indicates that the actor temporary or permanently stopped experiencing the recorded media object.""? However, the `played` verb reads ""Indicates that the actor started experiencing the recorded media object."", but there's no trigger of a `played` xAPI statement after `seeked`.

As I said, probably no deal breaker, but we'd like to know if we should change something.

I actually started with `playedSegments.slice()`, but since our array members are objects (`{start:0, end:0}`), `slice()` will only clone the array, and still use references to the original objects (shallow clone).
See:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42523881/how-to-clone-a-javascript-array-of-objects/42523934
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7486085/copying-array-by-value-in-javascript#answer-23536726

Right, that was a deep array ... Sorry.

No problem! I've got some time set aside today to go over the rest of the review comments, will keep you posted. (Likely we'll address some of them, and punt the more complicated ones to you folks...but we'll see! :)

I was getting this randomly in my testing, too (progress getting close to 1.0, but not quite reaching it). I noticed when repeatedly pausing/playing the video, the recorded end time when pausing and the recorded start time when playing would be a few milliseconds apart.

Example `playedSegments` where I paused an 8-second video twice, once around the 3 second mark, and once around the 5 second mark:
`0.018[.]3.116[,]3.124[.]5.056[,]5.074[.]8.021`

We've talked at length about what ""completing"" a video means, and I'm pretty sure it's not ""watched every last millisecond of the video."" But it's hard to pin down (what if a video rolls credits for a couple minutes at the end, can you skip that? What if a student skips a few seconds of a repetitive part in the middle of the video?).

For our purposes, I would be ok with allowing some delta away from 100% that would still be considered ""complete""; we could say `if (progress >= 0.95)`, or maybe define a class constant for some delta value, and then say `if (progress >= 1 - delta)`. Thoughts?

I can expand on this a bit. The video profile CoP agrees that there are use cases (technical or otherwise) that would require complete to trigger on a progress value < 1.0. 

We have a profile solution for this that we are finalizing. It requires adding an extension in the initialized statement that defines the minimum progress value used by the Activity Provider (H5P in this case) to trigger the completed statement. As long as this value exists then analysis can still be implement across data sets with different minimum values.

The issue is.. where is this value set for H5P? I think this is what @figureone is pointing out at the end. Short term solution is hard code `if (progress >= 0.95)`, but we would ideally prefer a UI element to set the delta. That being said, we are in a rush to get this done so that may be a change for down the road.

Whether `0.999` issue is H5P or not.. I am not sure. @jhaag75 & @liveaspankaj did most of the development on the communities videojs version. Perhaps they can say if they ran into this issue on there as well. 

I think this is okay @otacke. Ideally we would not trigger the extra pause statement, but I wouldn't hold it up for this. Any objection @liveaspankaj or @jhaag75?

The extra 'paused' should be removed if it is not ""required"" for any reason. 


Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the pause event is fired by the players and we just have listeners on the players.  HTML5 player triggers a paused event when seek happens and Youtube's paused and seeked  event are determined by the state, but in either case this would require saving data from pause event somewhere and then sending it later after the next event in order to determine whether it was a pause or a seeked event was occurring.  This could get complicated IMO.

It may not be ideal, but a very simple solution would be to simply listen to mousedown and mouseup events to alternate a blocking variable that you can check for distinguishing pause from seeked.

@otacke I'm not a 100% if that will work in all cases or where to put that in your code base since your project seems to be utilizing only listeners for the specific players.  If you have a good location on where you want to put this or have a proof of concept you are thinking of I would love to see it and would definitely like to see that change implemented.

For trying that out, you could have `this.mousedown = false;` (or private later) in the handler and then something like ...

    document.on('mousedown', function() {
      self.mousedown = true; // given that self is the right this ;-)
    });
    document.on('mouseup', function() {
      self.mousedown = false;
    });

    // This is part of what should be in video.js, see other comment
    self.on('paused', function (event) {
      // if mouse button is down, we're seeking
      if (self.mousedown === false) {
        this.triggerXAPI('paused', event.data);
      }
    });

@otacke on of the issues is that we have had a hard time determining where you guys want things in your code base and we would like to try to avoid lots of back and forths.  If this is something you can get to work we would appreciate you implementing this.

Sure!

@otacke thank you very much!  I really appreciate it!

I idea of Video Profile is not to just pass the player's events to the LRS but to modify them as needed. 
If the player doesn't have a ""seeking"" kind of state that tells if paused was sent for pause click or for seeking. Then, I agree that you might need to look at two things:
1. mouse/touch state
2. next event if it happens immediately (e.g. if someone clicks on another point in the progress bar, it might generate a pause and seek event in succession) ?




I had faced the issue of fractional time gap between paused/play even if they happen at the same point in the player. 

For that what I did  in VideoJS prototype was:
When a play happens, I checked the difference between time of play and last paused. And when the time difference was less than 1 seconds. I used the paused time instead of actual reported play time. 
e.g. paused at 12.31 second. then play at 12.78 second. I use 12.31 second as the play time. 

Probably, 1-2 second adjustment for margin of error could be done for progress calculation too?

Regarding adjusting progress value. I guess, it is a tough decision, and could be left to the user or decided by the authoring tool (H5P)




Confirmed bug, I fixed it here: https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/4346b9257ca5211c776ea14fc0291495aed8a11b

Note that a larger fix is probably needed so we don't trigger any xAPI statements in the editing environment. I think checking for existence of `H5PEditor` should either be in core in the `triggerXAPI()` definition in `h5p-x-api.js:21`, or we wrap each call to `triggerXAPI()` with the editor check. But I think this fix will need to wait for refactoring the xAPI event triggers out of html5.js/youtube.js and into video.js.

Finally, good call on saving a copy of `getXAPIObject()`, I've done that here: https://github.com/h5p/h5p-video/pull/17/commits/6c0dbf9a4f22c99b4d9a363eb09552e37737af46

Unfortunately, for technical reasons explained below, you can't change the interpolation variables in a translation, without also changing the key.

The technical reason is that the interpolation variables must be exactly the same in all translations for the same key. It can take several weeks, or longer, for all the translators to update their translations, and in the meantime the code would not work in those languages. So if you change the interpolations in a value, you need to change the key (e.g. `subject_own`) to something else too.

Why does it return the count? The method that calls this method can do the count on the array too, right?

Also, I'm a bit afraid doing select queries without any limit. Check other timeline implementations. They use `trait TimelineTrait::getTimelineResults()` to build the filtering.

I changed this.

Hi @escopecz,
paging these events did not work. I fixed this.

Best,
Alan

The PHP engine was removed from the 5.x branch. Please use html.twig files only. But in this case I wonder if we can omit the template completely when it's empty.

Be careful with queries like this as searching with wildcards from the beginning is expensive as it cannot use indexes. So if the table grows into hundreds of thousands then searching will become unusable as it will time out the request and cause issues for the users. In many places we use only wildcard at the end of the string.

Also, does it make sense to search in the type? It's already handled above. But why the ""like"" operator was used there?

I deleted this template.

Hi @escopecz, 
In the timeline search, page hits are also searched in this way. 
```
        // app/bundles/PageBundle/Entity/HitRepository.php  
        // Line: 86
        $query->andWhere($query->expr()->like('p.title', $query->expr()->literal('%'.$options['search'].'%')));        
```
e.g. 

without a wildcard from the beginning, there will be no focus named ""[DPMMA-1743] focus test"" in the result:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100592709/229822137-928d84ea-4866-4a2f-a202-a51891fa20ca.png)

ant with a wildcard from the beginning yes:

A type search makes sense when its search phrase ""click"" or ""view"":

but It doesn't sense with ""like"" operator. I Changed this. 

In conclusion you are right that searching with wildcard is expensive. However, removing the wildcard from the beginning will limit the search possibilities. I leave the final decision in this matter to you :).


```suggestion
     * @var ?Lead
```
When you create a fresh entity then this is null. 
```php
$stat = new Stat();
$stat->getLead(); // returns null, not Lead
```

I thought you wrote that you've changed the `like` into `eq` but it's still there. [I've read](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/543580/equals-vs-like) that `like` is 300 times slower compared to `eq`. It will differ based on the amount of data in the table, but still. Why not make it faster?
```suggestion
            $q->expr()->eq('s.type', ':type');
```
And somewhere bellow you'll set the param:
```php
$q->setParameter('type', $type);
```

Same here. Why use `like` over `eq`?

I'm afraid I can't let this be merged. We've done this mistake many times and it resulted in angry customers that cannot load a page when they start searching. If I wouldn't learn from past mistakes then what good am I?

To make a compromise between usablity and performance, change this to
```suggestion
                $q->expr()->like('f.name', $q->expr()->literal($options['search'].'%')),
                $q->expr()->like('f.description', $q->expr()->literal($options['search'].'%')),
```
And add indexes on the `Stat` entity on these 2 columns + migration for existing Mautic instances adding those indexes.

I changed this.

I changed this.

I changed it for search in 's.type'. I leave 'like' for wildcard searches.

No problemo :) 
I changed the wildcard for 'f.name' and removed the 'f.description' search. 
I added the index and migration 'f.name'

Nice foreign key relationship!

This definitely works! For an extra challenge, see if you can think of how to re-write this with less duplication of code. It might be helpful to start off with a dictionary with all the shared values, and then only add the additional values you need in the conditionals.

Nice use of truthiness and the ternary operator!

Awesome condensed code here!

Cool use of try and except! I especially like that you specify that `KeyError` is the only type of exception that should be caught.

Nice compact return statement.

Consider using `get_or_404` here to avoid the repeated `if task is None` later in this function.

Nice job getting the token from the environment variables! You might consider fetching the variable from the OS once, and then keeping it saved so that your code does not need to do `os.environ.get` every time a task is completed. This could be achieved in a way similar to how the environment variables are handled in `app/__init__.py`. You might also consider a bit more descriptive of a environment variable name, perhaps something like `SLACK_API_TOKEN`.

Very cool idea making the completion status a dynamic part of the route! I hadn't considered doing it that way!

Consider adding logic here to send back an error code if the user attempts to pass in an invalid `completion_status`

This looks great! As an additional challenge, can you think of how you would do this in a list comprehension? Either way is fine, it's just a matter of personal style.

Consider adding validation here so an error response is made if the user passes in a non-integer `goal_id`

👍🏻

Nice job asserting that both the response is correct and the DB is updated.

setCookie(

	this.config.cookieDomain

```

`cookieExpiresAfterDays` could then be a `const` var.

This is not related to the code but I'm mentioning it here so it is in the review : 
could you update the README to document this feature?

I agree with falsies values but `0` as an integer has a meaning for cookie expiration which ends when browser is closed. Using `cookieExpiresAfterDays || 120` will replace `0` to `120` which may not be the expected behavior by the end developer.

To not break existing installations, the default could apply to non-functional `cookieExpiresAfterDays` (like before this feature). When used as a function it'll be up to the developer to explicitly return a value if he don't want a session cookie.

Sure! Documented here: https://github.com/empreinte-digitale/orejime/pull/79/commits/e0270778dccf26f050938e30dd5685669f07c3f4

I didn't know about this behavior with 0, given the old implementation I thought it was kind of invalid.
I'm kind of torn here, it would be a breaking change to modify the current behavior, but it seems odd to have different behaviors for different methods...

Great!

Why do you create from a char, a std::string when the function is of type std::string_view?

This else is not necessary, remove it to make it easier to read.

Do not re-declare variables in a smaller scope if the name was used in the higher scope, this makes it difficult to read the scope and is very error prone.

A version with these bugs fixed would be something like:
```cpp

void updateDoc(json::Json& doc,
               std::string_view header,
               std::string_view value,
               bool is_escaped,
               std::string_view escape,
               bool is_quoted)
{
    if (value.empty())
    {
        doc.setNull(header);
        return;
    }

    // If the value is not quoted, try parsing it as an int or double
    if (!is_quoted)
    {
        // Try parsing as int
        int64_t i;
        auto [ptr, ec] {utils::from_chars(value.data(), value.data() + value.size(), i)};
        if (std::errc() == ec && (value.data() + value.size()) == ptr)
        {
            doc.setInt64(i, header);
            return;
        }

        // Try parsing as double
        double_t d;
        auto [ptr2, ec2] {utils::from_chars(value.data(), value.data() + value.size(), d)};
        if (std::errc() == ec2 && (value.data() + value.size()) == ptr2)
        {
            doc.setDouble(d, header);
            return;
        }
    }

    // If the value is a string, unescape it if necessary and add it to the JSON document
    auto vs = std::string {val.data(), val.size()};
    unescape(is_escaped, vs, escape);
    doc.setString(vs, header);
}
```
I have not tested it (nor compiled it :rofl: ), but I recommend to take it into account for changes.

The doxygen documentation is missing, and you could change the names from hdr to header? or Key?, val to value. I think it would be more readable

I agree, I will replace it

Update documentation with te new parameters added to runTest(

This could be moved inside runTest(), right? calling it with both new parameters and testing this 3 scenarios inside that function:
1. without header and tail
2. with both
3. with header
4. with tail

Ok, I made the changes and tested it, and it works  

Ok, I take your suggestion. I will make the changes.

try to avoid non-english names

can this be merged into a single block?
```
auto stopString = printStop(std::get<2>(t));
std::list<std::string> stopPrueba = (stopString == emptyString ? {matrix[i][1]} : {stopString});
parser = parserBuilder({}, stopString, std::get<3>(t));
```
not checked but it can be use as a base idea

if the method that throws the exception is the parse builder, then I think it could be better to not include the rest.

Fix doxy documentation

Please check this decoder:

```yml
---
name: decoder/zz_test/0

metadata:
  description: Accept all

check: +ef_exists/wazuh.queue AND (+i_eq/wazuh.queue/49 OR +i_eq/wazuh.queue/50)

parse:
  logpar:
    - event.original: ""<~test_tail/alphanumeric> %%%""
    - event.original: ""### <~test_offset/alphanumeric>""
    - event.original: ""### <~test_offset_and_tail/alphanumeric> %%%""

```
there is an issue with cases where the % % % characters are included. Specifically, the decoder is failing when it encounters the following two cases:

`### 123 %%%`
`123 %%%`

I will fix the parser to properly handle these cases. Once the parser is fixed, I will update the tests and the runtest if necessary.

To clarify the order in which I will make the fixes:

Fix the parser to handle cases with theoffset and tail.
Update the tests to ensure that all cases are handled correctly
If necessary, update the runtest to verify that the decoder works as expected in a real-world scenario

remember to keep the variables at the right of the comparison

Why do you create from a char, a std::string when the function is of type std::string_view?

This else is not necessary, remove it to make it easier to read.

Do not re-declare variables in a smaller scope if the name was used in the higher scope, this makes it difficult to read the scope and is very error prone.

A version with these bugs fixed would be something like:
```cpp

void updateDoc(json::Json& doc,
               std::string_view header,
               std::string_view value,
               bool is_escaped,
               std::string_view escape,
               bool is_quoted)
{
    if (value.empty())
    {
        doc.setNull(header);
        return;
    }

    // If the value is not quoted, try parsing it as an int or double
    if (!is_quoted)
    {
        // Try parsing as int
        int64_t i;
        auto [ptr, ec] {utils::from_chars(value.data(), value.data() + value.size(), i)};
        if (std::errc() == ec && (value.data() + value.size()) == ptr)
        {
            doc.setInt64(i, header);
            return;
        }

        // Try parsing as double
        double_t d;
        auto [ptr2, ec2] {utils::from_chars(value.data(), value.data() + value.size(), d)};
        if (std::errc() == ec2 && (value.data() + value.size()) == ptr2)
        {
            doc.setDouble(d, header);
            return;
        }
    }

    // If the value is a string, unescape it if necessary and add it to the JSON document
    auto vs = std::string {val.data(), val.size()};
    unescape(is_escaped, vs, escape);
    doc.setString(vs, header);
}
```
I have not tested it (nor compiled it :rofl: ), but I recommend to take it into account for changes.

The doxygen documentation is missing, and you could change the names from hdr to header? or Key?, val to value. I think it would be more readable

I agree, I will replace it

Update documentation with te new parameters added to runTest(

This could be moved inside runTest(), right? calling it with both new parameters and testing this 3 scenarios inside that function:
1. without header and tail
2. with both
3. with header
4. with tail

Ok, I made the changes and tested it, and it works  

Ok, I take your suggestion. I will make the changes.

try to avoid non-english names

can this be merged into a single block?
```
auto stopString = printStop(std::get<2>(t));
std::list<std::string> stopPrueba = (stopString == emptyString ? {matrix[i][1]} : {stopString});
parser = parserBuilder({}, stopString, std::get<3>(t));
```
not checked but it can be use as a base idea

if the method that throws the exception is the parse builder, then I think it could be better to not include the rest.

Fix doxy documentation

Please check this decoder:

```yml
---
name: decoder/zz_test/0

metadata:
  description: Accept all

check: +ef_exists/wazuh.queue AND (+i_eq/wazuh.queue/49 OR +i_eq/wazuh.queue/50)

parse:
  logpar:
    - event.original: ""<~test_tail/alphanumeric> %%%""
    - event.original: ""### <~test_offset/alphanumeric>""
    - event.original: ""### <~test_offset_and_tail/alphanumeric> %%%""

```
there is an issue with cases where the % % % characters are included. Specifically, the decoder is failing when it encounters the following two cases:

`### 123 %%%`
`123 %%%`

I will fix the parser to properly handle these cases. Once the parser is fixed, I will update the tests and the runtest if necessary.

To clarify the order in which I will make the fixes:

Fix the parser to handle cases with theoffset and tail.
Update the tests to ensure that all cases are handled correctly
If necessary, update the runtest to verify that the decoder works as expected in a real-world scenario

remember to keep the variables at the right of the comparison

This could help in the transition from XML to YAML files for people.

Is the `singularity pull` currently being called? Last time I setup something relying on singularity, I had to have a mechanism of getting the tool containers apriori I think. Or maybe I did this to avoid issues with concurrent pulls when dataset collections where the first ones to request the pull of an image... not sure. Might be good to know as well if concurrent `singularity pull` calls are somehow avoided currently.

Maybe a mention could be added here to the ability to create multi tool containers via the biocontainers UI / pull request mechanism? Or to subscribe your tool list to the CI that monitors tools that get added to the toolshed for this kind of tools?

Indeed. 

And maybe also a schema definition? But I don't understand those yet. Guess it wont be more than a mapping anyway (except maybe for the mapping resolver).



Some of them do:

- `cached_explicit_singularity` triggers a pull over [here](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/c517e805771cc16807dfe675075a13fe6343f01f/lib/galaxy/tool_util/deps/container_resolvers/explicit.py#L106)
- `mulled` and `mulled_singularity` trigger pulls [here](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/c517e805771cc16807dfe675075a13fe6343f01f/lib/galaxy/tool_util/deps/container_resolvers/mulled.py#L592) which are then executed in the respective methods [here for `mulled`](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/c517e805771cc16807dfe675075a13fe6343f01f/lib/galaxy/tool_util/deps/container_resolvers/mulled.py#L540) and [here for `mulled_singularity`](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/c517e805771cc16807dfe675075a13fe6343f01f/lib/galaxy/tool_util/deps/container_resolvers/mulled.py#L632)

The pull happens when `install=True` (which is apparently the case when called during job preparation and when build is triggered from the container dependencies tab in the admin UI) ... seems that the value of `auto_intstall` is important here as well since it determines if the container description uses the URI / the path to the image (but I don't fully understand this yet).

The `cached_mulled*` only lookup the cache. 

I wrote a bit here already https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/889f7f7413d0b3609b6829279f678e8a0e06e63f/doc/source/admin/container_resolvers.rst#building-resolver-types

It misses at the moment that also bioconda pushes to biocontainers. Maybe it should be moved to a separate subsection and also quay.org and namespaces need to be mentioned. Will put it on my todo list.

```suggestion
All mulled resolvers compute a mulled hash that describes the requirements and
```

```suggestion
  of the directory can be accessed uncached (in which case, the file listing is computed for each access)
```

+1 to YAML. Also, the container config is generally so simple that I'm putting it inline in galaxy.yml anyway.

Link not working I think.

Should work when merged :) 

This seems currently unused?

Hmm. If I grep in my current source tree I find it used in `lib/galaxy/app_unittest_utils/galaxy_mock.py`. Could you check the diff with f9116e9308?

Wrong commit. It's: 894cdece7a



I think it's used in `test/integration/test_container_resolvers.py` when you have:

```python
    container_resolvers_config: List[Dict[str, Any]] = [
        {""type"": ""null""},
    ]
```

?

Ah, yes. I think I used this 'trick' to create the case where the resolver can resolve...

```suggestion
The latter are containers built for a set of requirements of type ``package``.
```

```suggestion
Galaxy can run tools inside containers using ``docker`` or ``singularity``.
```

```suggestion
Bioconda and the Galaxy project provide infrastructure to create mulled
```

```suggestion
   (which includes for instance tools-iuc and several other tool repositories).
```

```suggestion

```suggestion

```

```suggestion

```suggestion

```

```suggestion
   For distributed compute systems, built-in techniques of docker may be useful:
```

```suggestion

```

```suggestion
    In contrast to the uncached explicit resolver, the uncached mulled resolvers
```

```suggestion
  For the non-building resolvers this controls if a container description pointing to the

```suggestion

```

```suggestion
It can be cleaned regularly using the ``singularity cache`` command, or disabled by using the
```

```suggestion
``SINGULARITY_DISABLE_CACHE`` environment variable.
```

This line is unclear.

I think I wanted to write:

```suggestion
globally for an instance and/or per execution environment, see [Container resolvers](container_resolvers.md).
```

Does this make more sense?

I also realized that I often wrote compute environment instead of execution environment .. I will fix this.

I just have to note once that I don't really like that destinations have been renamed to execution environments. IMO the not (really clearly) speaking name was not the real problem, but the lack of definition what a destination/execution environment is. This is still missing (but I have to admit that the name is a bit better) and we have inconsistent naming in docs and code :( .. maybe it's my formal/math background that suggests me that a name is not important as long as it is defined and used consistently.


> Does this make more sense?

Yes, thanks, can you please make the change?

```suggestion
```

Are the comments in this and the following file needed?

```suggestion
globally for an instance of locally per instance, see [Container resolvers](container_resolvers).
```

```suggestion

```

```suggestion
          For available options see https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/container_resolvers.html
```

Debugging statement?

```suggestion
```

I remember that I played around with them. Lets just try to enable them and see what fails. I think this makes the tests stronger since it ensures that the tests really use containers and do not fall back to conda (which is the default).

```suggestion
      require_container: true
```

```suggestion
      require_container: true
```

```suggestion
      require_container: true
```

```suggestion
globally for an instance and/or per execution environment, see [Container resolvers](container_resolvers).
```

```suggestion
# Sample file for container resolvers. Resolvers that are potentially used by default
```

```suggestion
  # and note the minor difference in the default for the directory
```

`cached_explicit_mulled` doesn't seem to exist?

```suggestion
# The mapping container resolver allows to specify a list of mappings from tools
```

```suggestion
# (tool_id) to containers (type and identifier).
```

```suggestion
    @staticmethod
    def parse_volume_str(rawstr: str) -> Tuple[str, str, str]:
```

```suggestion
  # and cache_directory_cacher_type. See the description at `cached_explicit_singularity`
```

is this whole section here not equivalent to
```python
return list(set(str(v) for v in volumes))
```
?

Where's the `/tmp` coming from here ?

I don't think that's understandable or even really configurable in a useful way ... maybe remove this ? No-one should need to mess with `hash_func`, and I doubt any namespace that is not biocontainers will work (but if you want to test this out that'd be welcome of course)

I don't know what you mean by redundant

Can you make that the default ? No need to throw hurdles in the way of admins.

Again seems unnecessary

This seems to come a bit out of nowhere, was this meant to go into
the ""Building container resolvers"" section 

Or maybe I don't understand what you mean by `Build a mulled container description to quay.io/NAMESPACE/MULLED_HASH` ?

I think a crucial point missing here is that if there's no prefix we're talking about docker.

That is so much of an implementation detail ... see above

Below it seems `build_mulled` and `build_mulled_singularity` are enabled by default ? That can't be right ?!

I don't think we should break the type annotation for the published package.

`if not cache_directory_path and self.app_info:`

In any case I don't think we should have this here just for the purpose of a test.

Don't think we should break this.

but it doesn't need to be on shared storage, right ?

For starters the resolution is a lot faster, you should definitely not disable it, which one might think if they were to read this.

That seems like a regression

This is much too long for the number of tests we're doing here.

A rough comparison with the the integration test run for the merge commit (https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/actions/runs/5327223927/) and a recent run on dev before these changes (https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/actions/runs/5294112030/) seems to suggest that's 20 to 30 minutes per job.

I wanted to keep the code as (much as possible as) it is before we have 

Not sure. It's `volumes[i].target` that is used for deciding if a volume is deleted. 



This should be related to:

> I tried to change no functionality except for the following three commits which should fix https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/15673



We can try to revert it, but I guess this might imply changes at other places. 

Guess this is one of the changes that would be implied. Maybe it's not more than this.

Should be mostly due to the tests for the `*build*` resolvers.

I just wanted to highlight  that this will be the name of the container (even if it is not downloaded from quay.io).

Agreed.

They are, if docker is available: https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/e12c7993f1ef9c2a0777e979ea16de3085d99203/lib/galaxy/tool_util/deps/containers.py#L338

I mean that `cached_mulled_singularity` does the same independent of the `namespace`. It just does not use it. Therefore they are redundant. 

See, https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/15623 .. but we did not agree on this before. 

Hmm, another weird default. I guess there's no easy way to know if we need singularity images to be built.

I think it is the default.

But you can't get a different string representation of a Volume instance for the same target, right ?

I mean the cached version.

It's probably worth converging on (and documenting) an Azure convention going forward.

`cache_key` seems clear enough in this context, though I can also see that causing confusion with the cache_key used [with the local disk cache](https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian/blob/df9b68f8e9309254ff2b70735e2ec195010e1ba8/tools/c7n_azure/c7n_azure/query.py#L265-L282).

I like this clear/explicit handling of the previous behavior :+1: 

I know this is closed now, but the idea of annotations is something that I don't fully understand. My assumption has been that it is meant as an addition to the resource data that would show up in the final output for a matched resource. However, I'm not aware of any documentation around their use, and the confusing part is that the annotation also tends to end up being a local cache for filter data which is separate from the more generic cache you mention.

All that to say I agree there should be a standard for handling what is a pretty common pattern across filters.

There is also the ionic `padding` option. [(see this link)](https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/css-utilities) Did you consider using that? I can imagine you want a more specific padding, but in that case its better to rename `.padded` into something a bit more descriptive. For example `.small_padding`

Or you could split the router.url based on `/` and subtract the last term. It depends a bit if this is worth the change, is the tutorial going to be accessible only through the about page?

Why do you only want this button when entering from the about page? Why not always have the option to cancel the tutorial?

See comment about `ion.padding`

This class seems to be the same for each step. You could make a single class named `.step` and add that to each step in the html.

Could you extend this test to also see if it goes to `/about` when needed.

Yes, it is intended this way, so that the home page is never empty. If the user decides to unsubscribe from all their movements, the tutorial just comes back, which will redirect to the movements page if finished.

The app-'something' is the name of the component selector, so that this page appears here. For all pages, the selector starts with app, e.g. app-add-movement, or app-home. So I stuck to this convention also for the tutorial page.

The idea is that if the tutorial appears on the home page, this is because the user is not subscribed to any movements, so the tutorial fills the home page. The user can always navigate away from the homepage if they want, but the idea is that the user finishes the tutorial and is then navigated to the movements page. If the user opens the tutorial from the about page, this can also happen by accident (selected the wrong button), or because they just want to get a quick look. So for those cases, I put the close button in the corner for easy dismissal.

Sharp. They were different colors before, but that didn't look good with the animations. So now it is indeed just one style.

Then you probably also want to overwrite the router return address when coming from the home page. Because now if your home page is empty, and thus the tutorial is shown, what happens when you try and return to the previous page? This is now again the home page, and thus shows you the same tutorial page again. That may give the user the idea that he/she is stuck.

I will check it thoroughly tomorrow. The way it is now is that if the
homepage is empty, the tutorial component gets loaded in the homepage. So
the router is still set at 'home', except that the content that is
displayed is from the tutorial. So if the user then navigates back, they
will land at the page where they were before 'home'. But I'll make sure to
check it.

You haven't gotten back to him yet.

Hello, I am actively working on testing the Nuget package with these changes. Based on what I see on iOS,  	`await DailySummaryHandler!.ExposureStateUpdatedAsync(windows, dailySummary)` is never called, indicating that something here might be out of control. `ExposureDetectedAsync` is not called either. I managed to apply the new configuration object, and in the phone settings I see that the analysis of the submitted keys with the new configuration went well and multiple matches are found, however, `ExposureStateUpdatedAsync()` on the handler is never called.

No exceptions are thrown.

@mattleibow The same results from my debugging. It seems detectionSummary.DaySummaries.Length is always 0 or even null. 

When using the V2 TEK format in the zip file (with DSOS and ReportType), iOS' `ExposureStateUpdatedAsync` is called. So there is no issue here, just managed to verify it yesterday.

FYI @tmurakami 

You are correct, @tmurakami, this is not called in the nuget code. We ended up into calling `SetDiagnosisKeysDataMappingAsync` manually before calling `UpdateKeysFromServer`. Ideally, this should be called on Android after getting keys and configuration, so it won't send one more request to the server to fetch configuration one more time. There is, apparently, a limit on number of time how often this API can be called, so I would recommend either catching the exception when this limit is reached, or ensure that the method is not called more often than once a week ([src](https://developers.google.com/android/exposure-notifications/meaningful-exposures#map-diag-keys))

Ideally we provide everything that could impact the navigation or accessibility.

One thing we can do to help our routes file from getting too large is to consider making multiple files containing routes separated by the resource type. We might have a `routes` folder instead of a `routes.py` file, and inside that folder (along with a `__init__.py`) we could have a file per resource, so `task.py` and `goal.py`. Where each would have a blueprint and endpoints for that resource. When we have one blueprint per file, we often name the blueprint simply `bp` rather  than including the resource name as part of it.

Then here, we could import and register the blueprints like
```python
    from .routes import task, goal
    app.register_blueprint(task.bp)
    app.register_blueprint(goal.bp)
```


Should we be able to create a goal with a NULL title? Consider adding `nullable=False` here.


👍 

Nice helper to convert from a model instance to a dict for JSON results.

Unless you are actually calling the `jsonify` method in the file (which I don't see) there's no need to import `jsonify`. Though come to think of it, I don't see `current_app` used here, so I don't know why the boilerplate code included that import at all! 😂 

Neat class helper to load goals with optional filter. One thing to be careful of is what we should always try to return consistent result type from methods, so if one path returns a list of results, we should generally try to return lists (even if they are empty do to no results)  fo consistency. This can help the function caller write simpler code. Currently, if `title_from_url` is falsy, this function falls through and would return `None`. Returning `None` can be ok (though we should generally do it explicitly, otherwise it can look like we simply forgot to think about that case), but if we returned an empty list, then the caller could always simply iterate over any (possible no) results safely. But currently, they would first need to perform a falsy check first.

All that being said, I don't see this being used anywhere else in the code currently?

Here again, be careful with the imports. None of the changes that were done here import symbols that are actually being used in this file, so they're unnecessary.

According to the SqlAlchemy docs about [autoincrement](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/metadata.html#sqlalchemy.schema.Column.params.autoincrement):

> The default value is the string ""auto"" which indicates that a single-column primary key that is of an INTEGER type with no stated client-side or python-side defaults should receive auto increment semantics automatically; all other varieties of primary key columns will not.

This means that here, since the primary is not a compound key, the type is integer, and there's no specified default value, the desired autoincrement behavior will apply even without listing it. It wouldn't hurt anything to list it, but it's not required.


It turns out that `nullable=True` is the default value for nullable. So all of the columns for Task here are currently impicitly marked as nullable. But should title or description be allowed to be NULL? (Does that make sense from a data standpoint?) Consider adding `nullable=False` to those columns.

The way the project emphasized that completed_at needs to accept NULL values may make it seem like we needed to explicitly call out that nullable should be True, but it turns out this is the default for nullable. Instead, we should think about the other data in our model and consider whether it makes sense for any of it to be NULL. If not, we can have the database help us protect against that happening!


👍 

Nice job providing this helper, and having it selectively include the goal id in the output if present.

👍 

Here, we definitely need `jsonify` and `request`, but it doesn't look like you're using `make_response` anywhere (no need for it).

Notice that the logic for GET and POST doesn't share any code, so if we wanted to try refactoring this we could consider putting the logic for each in separate functions, maybe `get_tasks` and `create_task`.


👍 

Why not use your `task_dict` method to generate this dictionary?

👍 

Good job enforcing the POST data requirements. We should be doing similar checks when PUTting a task as well. So we could also think about moving checks like this into validation helpers so that they are easier to reuse elsewhere.

We could even think about adding a class method to `Task` to create a new `Task` using the dictionary from a request body

```python
    @classmethod
    def from_dict(values):
        # create a new task, and set the model values from the values passed in
        # be sure to validate that all required values are present, we could return `None` or raise an error if needed
        return new_task
```


Consider using `utcnow()` rather than `now()`, especially if there's no timezone information on the datetime in the database. When working with dates and time, it's usually a good idea to pass them around and store them in UTC, and only convert them to local time when needed for display (like in a UI). Working with dates and times is tricky!

👍 

Nice helper to take care up updating the completion status of a task!

Notice that this chunk of looking up an id, checking for None, and returning a 404 when not found recurs frequently. It's a little tricky to extract this into a helper function, mostly since a helper function can't force the calling function to exit. That is, unless it raises an error. So we could think about writing a helper function to perform this set of steps, but we would also need to customize the Flask error handling behavior to return JSON rather than HTML. There _is_ the `get_or_404` method that essentially does the lookup with errors already, but we would should still update the flask error handling (see [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/errorhandling/#error-handlers) for more details.)

Another approach could be to use a decorator to intercept the task id from the route, and performt the lookup before reaching the body of our endpoint. There's an example of that [here](https://github.com/AdaGold/hello-books-api-decorated/blob/main/app/routes.py).


We should be sure that the same fields required for POSTing are included here for PUT. PUT _replaces_ the value for the supplied task id, so we should ensure that all of the values required to represent a `Task` are provided with the same restrictions as we had when creating it in the first place.

At the least, we should ensure that the keys are present in the dictionary before trying to access them, otherwise this request would cause a `KeyError`.


Another spot where `task_dict` could be used.

Similar feedback about splitting these functions, and moving validation and dictionary-handling logic around that I made for `Task` below will also apply to `Goal` here. These are common themes for any model with CRUD operations.


Don't forget about you `goal_dict` function. You should be able to use that here.

`list` will definitely have a value by the time the following conditions have been checked (each assigns to list), so the `None` here isn't all that dangerous, but it's a little confusing. If we're trying to fill in a list with deferred lookups, it's usually better to initialize the variable with an empty list rather than `None`, as it works as expected with iteration, while `None` would crash.

Also, consider using a name other than `list`, since that hides the class name `list`. Python lets us do this, but again, it can be confusing.

👍 

Nice sorting handling.

Another spot where `goal_dict` could be used.

Each of these verbs does depend on retrieving an existing task from the database by id, so there's a stronger case for keeping these together. But we could still think about splitting these into separate functions (e.g. `get_task`, `update_task`, and `delete_task`). We would need to either duplicate the lookup code in each function, or create a helper function that can be shared among the separated functions.


Don't forget to ensure that the result of calling `get` returns a valid Task. what if an invalid task id had been included in the input? Then we would get back a `None` that would get added to the list.

👍 

Assigning to the `tasks` relationship is absolutely a valid way to associate tasks with a goal.  We should also think about whether to interpret POSTing to this endpoint is setting the exact list of tasks that should be a part of the goal, or whether we are adding these tasks to the goal (in addition to anything that was already there). Neither the project description nor the test `test_post_task_ids_to_goal_already_with_goals` are entirely clear on the desired behavior. Which perspective does your implementation take? How could we implement the other approach?


Don't forget about `task_dict`. Helper methods get sad when they aren't used. 😀 

Don't forget to add a message to your migrations with `-m` when running the migration step.


This looks like an extra, unnecessary migration. Having this around could confuse flask, since both this and the other migration look like ""first"" migrations (neither has a non-None `down_revision` value, which is how flask traces back the migration dependencies). So flask could theoretically pick either as the first, and you could end up with weird situations where a deployment won't properly generate the tables on the remote server, even if it's working locally.

Try to keep an eye out for stray migrations and keep them tidy.

An alternative to directly accessing the DB here would be to make an additional GET request. Doing so keeps us at the same level of abstraction (exercising the web API) while still checking that a change has been made (deletion of the goal) without assuming how the deletion is occuring (maybe we want to use a deleted flag rather than actually deleting the row).

Unfortunately if it's passed like this it will override both the yt-dl default (good) and any user-specified value (not so good) because of the way header options are currently handled. Nothing to be done about that here.

I wonder why this isn't always set in `_download_json()` You'd have thought it should be the default there, but it just passes any `Accept` header straight through to `_download_webpage_handle()`.

```suggestion
```

Optional fields (we know that `data['livestream']` is a `dict` now):
```suggestion
        uploader = traverse_obj(data['livestream'], ('channel', 'user', 'username'), expected_type=lambda x: strip_or_none(x) or None)
        thumbnail = url_or_none(data['livestream'].get('thumbnail'))
```
You could just set `livestream = data['livestream']` here and move these into the returned info_dict.

Also you might define `lambda x: strip_or_none(x) or None` as a local function since it is proposed for use later as well. The point is that `strip_or_none()` returns `''` for a whitespace string whereas we want `None` to cause `traverse_obj()` to ignore such values.

Only include `url` when not using `formats`:
```suggestion
```


Also, from the example I posted in the linked issue:
  
```suggestion
            'timestamp': traverse_obj(data, 'updated_at', 'created_at', expected_type=parse_iso8601),
            'release_timestamp': parse_iso8601(data.get('created_at')),
            'view_count': int_or_none(data.get('views')),
            'channel_id': strip_or_none(data['livestream'].get('channel_id')),
            'is_live': data['livestream'].get('is_live'),
            'duration': float_or_none(data['livestream'].get('duration'), scale=1000),
            'channel': traverse_obj(data['livestream'], ('channel', 'slug'), expected_type=lambda x: strip_or_none(x) or None),

        }
```
What do these `livestream` fields mean, though?
* `'source': 'obs',`
* `'playback_url': 'https://fa723fc1b171.us-west-2.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/us-west-2.196233775518.channel.xJf2jIQZk382.m3u8',`

Ahh yeah that's my bad. I had my IP blocked for a while for some reason (this is my assumption) and I was trying things to see if it would fix it. Forgot to delete this specific line.

Sounds like an issue that should be opened 👀

for ```source``` I assume it's the recording software used ([OBS ](https://obsproject.com/)is a popular choice for streamers)

for ```playback_url``` I'm not sure but my theory is that it's the url used _while_ the stream is happening (I'm just looking at the live-video hostname)

This format (and sorted) is easier to maintain.
```suggestion
from ..utils import (
    float_or_none,
    int_or_none,
    parse_iso8601,
    strip_or_none,
    traverse_obj,

)
```

Yes, but enough cans of worms are open ATM ...

            'is_live': livestream.get('is_live'),
            'channel': traverse_obj(livestream, ('channel', 'slug'), expected_type=strip_lambda),

Is this different from the ID captured in the URL? If so, consider making one `display_id`. As you aren't using this one to get the media links, the search can/should have `default=None`.

```suggestion

```suggestion
            r'""name""\s*:\s*""(?P<title>(?:\\""|[^""])+)',
```
Also, you can use just `(...)` instead of the named group and skip the `group` parameter.

As before.

```suggestion
        manifest_url = urljoin(url, manifest_url)
        if manifest_url and determine_ext(manifest_url) == 'm3u8':

and add `urljoin` to imports, and skip the `compat_urlparse.urljoin(...)` at l.63.

That way only clients, that support custom emoji would render it as a link and they can know, that this is intended to share a custom emoji set. Otherwise users clicking the link might be confused and you can't really use emoji inside of link descriptions anymore.

You probably want to specify some prefix for the pack_url field, so that you don't reserve the name, while this MSC is still unmerged. It would add some more overhead to each event, but I think it is nicer for the ecosystem to namespace independent MSCs. :)

(Once that exists, I would probably start implementing it)

I think I would prefer this to be a bit more lenient. A user should be able to disable this, but also I would like it, if a client is allowed to share a link to a pack, as long as every recipient would be able to access the pack. For example in a closed community, if there is a room with sticker packs, that any of the community members could join using ""restricted joins"" or ""knocking"", then sharing a link to the pack would still be nice. For invite only rooms it of course never makes sense.

What's the use case for having this work outside of Matrix clients?

The links should be sharable outside of Matrix, such as over other social media.  This can allow users to post lists and collections of image packs on those platforms.

I'll update the doc to say that links should be sharable outside of Matrix clients - the link itself will still lead to opening Matrix.

That means I should be able to share a link outside matrix, but I don't need the embedding in the message to be accessible outside matrix, right? I.e. it doesn't need to be a link embedded into the img tag for that to work, but a data attribute fulfills that in the same way, since the attribute would still be a matrix.to link?

This means you probably want to add some metadata to the matrix.to link, so that it can be distinguished from a normal event link, I guess? I.e. appending a ?image_pack or so?

I figure that for closed communities, the community organizers already have a way to distribute their image packs to their members, so the utility is a little bit less.  The hope of this MSC is to allow public image packs to ""go viral"" and spread far beyond their original source.

Still, it makes sense that it doesn't hurt to allow these links.  In this case, I will leave it open as an optional feature.

Right, basically I just mean we want a matrix.to link, rather than some bespoke link that can only be clicked within a matrix client.  We don't need to expose any new data to the outside world.



Adding a query param won't automatically be passed through matrix.to to the matrix client.  This might be a useful expansion, but it adds a lot of complexity and I think it's functional as-is.

The person sharing the matrix.to link should be responsible for describing what it is - already a matrix.to event link doesn't give the room name or any other info, so sharers already have to do this.

You probably want clients as well as intermediates (like the matrix.to page) to know what the link is for before or without resolving it to the actual event. Otherwise matrix.to will just show ""you were invited to room X"". You probably want to be able to show, that you were linked to a sticker pack instead, which needs additional metadata in the link. Similarly you probably want clients to suggest you to add the sticker pack instead of scrolling to the event. This means again, you want extra metadata. In general such parameters are passed to clients, that can handle matrix.to, but possibly it would need to be supported by the matrix: scheme as well.

You don't really want clients to have to do some deep inspection of every matrix.to target to be able to use it and you don't want to have users paste the link into some field, but in the best case have it be automatic when clicking a link, that the client does the right thing. It is less complex to just add metadata to the matrix.to link than have every client do deep inspection of the link target before prompting the user what to do. That is why matrix.to already distinguishes between room, user and event links and why the matrix URI format has a specific action parameter, describing the purpose of a link. This is handled before any request is sent to a server, so that the user can decide what to do.

(resolved, but I can't do that myself)

(resolved, but I can't do that myself)

(resolved, but I can't do that myself)

Hmmm, action= seems like the right thing to do here.  Unfortunately, matrix.to and also Element don't honor this value.  You can see here that https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to/blob/main/src/open/clients/Nheko.js#L49 that action is harcoded depending on the resource type.  I think the only query params that work here are the ones on the matrix.to homepage.  Matrix.to always shows the same prompt ""choose app to continue"" regardless of the room type.

I think adding an additional metadata to the url does make sense, but it needs a bunch of additional things to move at the same time.  I'll document a bit more about what is wanted here though.

You can just add an unrecognized action. Clients that want to use that metadata can then do that, but if they don't recognize it, they should just ignore it and handle it like normal events, which I would say is fine :)

I can try to figure out a solution ? 

Hi @nisarhassan12! As suggested in our 1:1 discussion, please look into:
- [ ] How to write high-performance scroll event listeners (i.e. they should never block scrolling, and they should never be a performance problem -- I remember seeing various blog posts about how to do this from people in the front-end community, but I don't have a direct link)
- [ ] How to debounce things that happen too frequently (e.g. if this listener happens 1000 times per second, maybe you can debounce it such that it only happens a few times per second)

Additionally, I took a look at why the edge dots are sometimes not selected (last dot on desktop, first on mobile).

The value `element.scrollLeft` actually goes from `0` to `element.scrollWidth - element.clientWidth` (taking `clientWidth` into account is important). So:
- When `scrollLeft` is `0`, the left-most dot should be highlighted
- When `scrollLeft` is `scrollWidth - clientWidth`, the right-most dot should be highlighted
- When it's in-between, maybe you can divide the percentage by `scrollBy`, but first you'll need to verify that `scrollBy * cycles` is the same as `scrollWidth`

Hope this helps! Let me know if you still run into problems with this (then maybe we could finish solving it together in a call).

I've some suggestions:

1. Check if GDPR protection is enabled and the user has approved its data collection;
2. Use the own browser's geolocation API before using an external service;
3. If the geolocation API fails, request to `geoip-db.com` as a fallback;
4. Verify the limits for commercial use off `geoip-db.com` -- despite Rocket.Chat and this client being MIT; 
5. The `fetch()` API has some options to properly do CORS requests;
6. The ipify functionally can be implemented on Rocket.Chat's Livechat API, decreasing the number of requests needed.

Thanks for the review, will update it accordingly

Let's create a specific file/helper to provide this method.

We need to define the service which will provide the geolocation data on the server side.
Hardcoding is not a good approach.

Move this code to a specific file/helper.

Ok, let me do that

ok

So this is going out to this api to grab location?  This has to definitely be optional if done at all.  Some serious privacy concerns around sending data like this out.

Same here

I think you forget to remove this code before pushing your changes.

This is a clone from the `userPresence` lib, you don't need a new lib to do the same things, it does not make sense.
You can do what you want by calling the new methods related to session stuff within the `userPresence` lib.
Please, remove this file and move the new methods to a `helper` lib.

Why call this method here?
We have a specific lib to deal with user status.

Why not just one method to update the livechat session? 
You just need one method, you can pass specific data as parameters.

We don't need this lib.

I think this issue is a false positive and can be ignored.

Do you have any preference or suggestion on additional configuration knobs?

I guess a knob to turn of all certificate revocation checks off would probably be helpful, to mimic the previous behavior. Personally I would prefer if (online) revocation checks would be done by default, which might be expected by some TLS users.

I could contribute online CRL support as well, but that is rather complex, with delta-CRLs and such things. And not sure if online CRLs has really a future. Most or all public CAs do OCSP today, might be also a CAB Forum requirement (haven't checked). Letsencrypt does OCSP-only. So I wonder if online CRL is worth the burden.

No luck with codacy:

   `Condition 'bio==NULL' is always false`

Yes indeed I would recommend to have configuration options in imtcp and omfwd enabling  / disabling OCSP checking with default OFF to maintain existing behavior. 
With a name like ""StreamDriver.TlsVerifyOcsp"" (See other TLS Options in imtcp/omfwd doc): 
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/imtcp.html
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/omfwd.html

You needs some additional coding to pass the configuration option from the module down to the nsd driver. And also ""not implented"" wrappers in nsd_gtls and nsd_ptcp drivers. Here is an older PR where I added ""streamdriver.permitexpiredcerts"" which you can use a template: 
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/pull/3366

For now I would also recommend too leave it with OCSP for now. If CRL becomes more important in future, it can be discussed again.

Btw., it would be great if we could get a testcase for OCSP. Do you have an idea how to do make one that works with a free and reliable OCSP service?

Ok, I'll look into introduce those knobs.

With respect to the default behavior: Wouldn't a user/operator expect that the TLS drivers perform such online revocation check by default, if the CA/PKI is including those? E.g. if someone hosts a TLS rsyslog server with a public CA vendor, the server gets compromised the  end-entity certificate of the server revoked by the CA. The OCSP server would know about the revoked certificate, the TLS rsyslog clients could then be ""protected"" talking to a compromised/revoked certificate. At least that would be my naive expectation that TLS client comply with: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6 /  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6.3
(which is referred by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5425#section-4.2.1 )


I understand that this might break existing deployments under certain circumstances. But on the long run I would encourage to perform online revocation checks if OCSP (or CRL) URL are embedded in the  end-entity or in the certificate path:

```
$ openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509 -text -noout | grep -A5 -E '(Authority Information Access|CRL Distribution Points)'
            X509v3 CRL Distribution Points: 

                Full Name:
                  URI:http://crl3.digicert.com/sha2-ha-server-g6.crl

                Full Name:
--
            Authority Information Access: 
                OCSP - URI:http://ocsp.digicert.com
                CA Issuers - URI:http://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertSHA2HighAssuranceServerCA.crt

            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
                CA:FALSE
```

This would not affect existing deployment using private PKI environment without any CRL/OCSP URL in the issued certificate.

Not sure if ""ignoring"" OCSP/CRL URLs as part of certificate validation would be categorized as https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/299.html

(Yes, the browsers don't do by default live online reovcation either IIUC, but they have some sort of regular caches updated transparently to the user. So there is at least some revocation checking going on)

On the long run OCSP stapling support would be obviously nice. The initial motivation for us implementing this was fulfilling some security requirements as syslog+TLS client, not as server. Not sure if there is on the market already a OCSP stapling aware syslog server. Maybe something worth to look into to add for rsyslog in future.

Sure, first you need to issue a set of certificates with a OCSP URI (Authority Information Access) included. To generate such testing purposes I build this: https://github.com/danos/vyatta-security-vpn/tree/master/docs/x509

I'll look into the existing rsyslog UTs if I can enhance/add something to existing ossl related UTs.

For development I used openssl as OCSP responder/server:
```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10
```

The index.txt is the file which openssl generates when you use OpenSSL to build a PKI. In this example the certificate for server13 got revoked. And `openssl ocsp -index indext.txt` basically uses that file as revocation database.

```
$ cat index.txt
V       191110011802Z           00      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=client1/emailAddress=client1+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
V       191110011816Z           01      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=serverA/emailAddress=serverA+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
R       191110011822Z   181110011831Z   02      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=server13/emailAddress=server13+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
```

To make use of OCSP nonces add `-nonce`:

```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10 -nonce
```


I haven't checked other free/open implementations yet. FreeIPA/dogtag PKI might be worth a look. But for self-contained UTs `openssl ocsp` might be sufficient I guess.

The only other detailed behavior change between different production OCSP responder/server deployments, which are easy to overlook if you just use `openssl ocsp`: the HTTP requests need to hold a ""Host"" header entry. Most or many public CA vendor seem to use CDN providers to guarantee their OCSP availability and responsiveness.

> With respect to the default behavior: Wouldn't a user/operator expect that the TLS drivers perform such online revocation check by default, if the CA/PKI is including those? E.g. if someone hosts a TLS rsyslog server with a public CA vendor, the server gets compromised the end-entity certificate of the server revoked by the CA.

Thanks for the details, @rgerhards I think under these circumstances it is save and reasonable to have OCSP checking enabled by default with the possibility to disable it if needed.

> On the long run OCSP stapling support would be obviously nice. The initial motivation for us implementing this was fulfilling some security requirements as syslog+TLS client, not as server. Not sure if there is on the market already a OCSP stapling aware syslog server.

Probably not yet ;).

That would be fully sufficient as ocsp server to build a testcase on. 
It just needs to be started in background and killed on shutdown. 
This needs some additional plumbing in diag.sh like done for this test here:
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_omsnmpv1_udp.sh
(See snmp_start_trapreceiver  and snmp_stop_trapreceiver )

If you create sample ca / certifcates based on your script, but make them last longer (Like 36500 days) which is ok for the testbench, add them to here for example (tests/testsuites/x.509), you can use these tests as template to build your own test on: 

https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_tls_certvalid.sh
(Just replace '$RS_TLS_DRIVER' with ossl, as this will only run for openssl). 
And this tests: 
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/imtcp-tls-ossl-basic.sh

You can run single tests manually when you build rsyslog like this:
- go to rsyslog source dir
- export srcdir=./
- autoreconf -vfi 
- ./configure ... your options ...
- make && make check 
- ...wait until first tests runs then break with CTRL + C
- cd tests
- ./yourtestcase.sh

Yes indeed I would recommend to have configuration options in imtcp and omfwd enabling  / disabling OCSP checking with default OFF to maintain existing behavior. 
With a name like ""StreamDriver.TlsVerifyOcsp"" (See other TLS Options in imtcp/omfwd doc): 
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/imtcp.html
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/omfwd.html

Btw., it would be great if we could get a testcase for OCSP. Do you have an idea how to do make one that works with a free and reliable OCSP service?

Ok, I'll look into introduce those knobs.

With respect to the default behavior: Wouldn't a user/operator expect that the TLS drivers perform such online revocation check by default, if the CA/PKI is including those? E.g. if someone hosts a TLS rsyslog server with a public CA vendor, the server gets compromised the  end-entity certificate of the server revoked by the CA. The OCSP server would know about the revoked certificate, the TLS rsyslog clients could then be ""protected"" talking to a compromised/revoked certificate. At least that would be my naive expectation that TLS client comply with: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6 /  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6.3
(which is referred by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5425#section-4.2.1 )


I understand that this might break existing deployments under certain circumstances. But on the long run I would encourage to perform online revocation checks if OCSP (or CRL) URL are embedded in the  end-entity or in the certificate path:

```
$ openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509 -text -noout | grep -A5 -E '(Authority Information Access|CRL Distribution Points)'
            X509v3 CRL Distribution Points: 

                Full Name:
                  URI:http://crl3.digicert.com/sha2-ha-server-g6.crl

                Full Name:
--
            Authority Information Access: 
                OCSP - URI:http://ocsp.digicert.com
                CA Issuers - URI:http://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertSHA2HighAssuranceServerCA.crt

            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
                CA:FALSE
```

This would not affect existing deployment using private PKI environment without any CRL/OCSP URL in the issued certificate.

Not sure if ""ignoring"" OCSP/CRL URLs as part of certificate validation would be categorized as https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/299.html

(Yes, the browsers don't do by default live online reovcation either IIUC, but they have some sort of regular caches updated transparently to the user. So there is at least some revocation checking going on)

On the long run OCSP stapling support would be obviously nice. The initial motivation for us implementing this was fulfilling some security requirements as syslog+TLS client, not as server. Not sure if there is on the market already a OCSP stapling aware syslog server. Maybe something worth to look into to add for rsyslog in future.

Sure, first you need to issue a set of certificates with a OCSP URI (Authority Information Access) included. To generate such testing purposes I build this: https://github.com/danos/vyatta-security-vpn/tree/master/docs/x509

I'll look into the existing rsyslog UTs if I can enhance/add something to existing ossl related UTs.

For development I used openssl as OCSP responder/server:
```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10
```

The index.txt is the file which openssl generates when you use OpenSSL to build a PKI. In this example the certificate for server13 got revoked. And `openssl ocsp -index indext.txt` basically uses that file as revocation database.

```
$ cat index.txt
V       191110011802Z           00      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=client1/emailAddress=client1+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
V       191110011816Z           01      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=serverA/emailAddress=serverA+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
R       191110011822Z   181110011831Z   02      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=server13/emailAddress=server13+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
```

To make use of OCSP nonces add `-nonce`:

```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10 -nonce
```


I haven't checked other free/open implementations yet. FreeIPA/dogtag PKI might be worth a look. But for self-contained UTs `openssl ocsp` might be sufficient I guess.

The only other detailed behavior change between different production OCSP responder/server deployments, which are easy to overlook if you just use `openssl ocsp`: the HTTP requests need to hold a ""Host"" header entry. Most or many public CA vendor seem to use CDN providers to guarantee their OCSP availability and responsiveness.

Thanks for the details, @rgerhards I think under these circumstances it is save and reasonable to have OCSP checking enabled by default with the possibility to disable it if needed.

That would be fully sufficient as ocsp server to build a testcase on. 
It just needs to be started in background and killed on shutdown. 
This needs some additional plumbing in diag.sh like done for this test here:
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_omsnmpv1_udp.sh
(See snmp_start_trapreceiver  and snmp_stop_trapreceiver )

If you create sample ca / certifcates based on your script, but make them last longer (Like 36500 days) which is ok for the testbench, add them to here for example (tests/testsuites/x.509), you can use these tests as template to build your own test on: 

https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_tls_certvalid.sh
(Just replace '$RS_TLS_DRIVER' with ossl, as this will only run for openssl). 
And this tests: 
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/imtcp-tls-ossl-basic.sh

You can run single tests manually when you build rsyslog like this:
- go to rsyslog source dir
- export srcdir=./
- autoreconf -vfi 
- ./configure ... your options ...
- make && make check 
- ...wait until first tests runs then break with CTRL + C
- cd tests
- ./yourtestcase.sh

Long time no see Daniel ;)

I think this issue is a false positive and can be ignored. 
I have commented above on the other issue. 

Indeed, pretty long time :)

Pushed a bio==NULL variant.

Let's see if that passes codacy.


Do you have any preference or suggestion on additional configuration knobs?

I guess a knob to turn of all certificate revocation checks off would probably be helpful, to mimic the previous behavior. Personally I would prefer if (online) revocation checks would be done by default, which might be expected by some TLS users.

I could contribute online CRL support as well, but that is rather complex, with delta-CRLs and such things. And not sure if online CRLs has really a future. Most or all public CAs do OCSP today, might be also a CAB Forum requirement (haven't checked). Letsencrypt does OCSP-only. So I wonder if online CRL is worth the burden.

No luck with codacy:

   `Condition 'bio==NULL' is always false`

> No luck with codacy:

@rgerhards do you see the reason why this is detected as issue?

Yes indeed I would recommend to have configuration options in imtcp and omfwd enabling  / disabling OCSP checking with default OFF to maintain existing behavior. 
With a name like ""StreamDriver.TlsVerifyOcsp"" (See other TLS Options in imtcp/omfwd doc): 
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/imtcp.html
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/omfwd.html

You needs some additional coding to pass the configuration option from the module down to the nsd driver. And also ""not implented"" wrappers in nsd_gtls and nsd_ptcp drivers. Here is an older PR where I added ""streamdriver.permitexpiredcerts"" which you can use a template: 
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/pull/3366

That would be fully sufficient as ocsp server to build a testcase on. 
It just needs to be started in background and killed on shutdown. 
This needs some additional plumbing in diag.sh like done for this test here:
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_omsnmpv1_udp.sh
(See snmp_start_trapreceiver  and snmp_stop_trapreceiver )

If you create sample ca / certifcates based on your script, but make them last longer (Like 36500 days) which is ok for the testbench, add them to here for example (tests/testsuites/x.509), you can use these tests as template to build your own test on: 

https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_tls_certvalid.sh
(Just replace '$RS_TLS_DRIVER' with ossl, as this will only run for openssl). 
And this tests: 
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/imtcp-tls-ossl-basic.sh

You can run single tests manually when you build rsyslog like this:
- go to rsyslog source dir
- export srcdir=./
- autoreconf -vfi 
- ./configure ... your options ...
- make && make check 
- ...wait until first tests runs then break with CTRL + C
- cd tests
- ./yourtestcase.sh

Do you have any preference or suggestion on additional configuration knobs?

I guess a knob to turn of all certificate revocation checks off would probably be helpful, to mimic the previous behavior. Personally I would prefer if (online) revocation checks would be done by default, which might be expected by some TLS users.

I could contribute online CRL support as well, but that is rather complex, with delta-CRLs and such things. And not sure if online CRLs has really a future. Most or all public CAs do OCSP today, might be also a CAB Forum requirement (haven't checked). Letsencrypt does OCSP-only. So I wonder if online CRL is worth the burden.

No luck with codacy:

   `Condition 'bio==NULL' is always false`

@rgerhards do you see the reason why this is detected as issue?

Yes indeed I would recommend to have configuration options in imtcp and omfwd enabling  / disabling OCSP checking with default OFF to maintain existing behavior. 
With a name like ""StreamDriver.TlsVerifyOcsp"" (See other TLS Options in imtcp/omfwd doc): 
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/imtcp.html
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/omfwd.html

You needs some additional coding to pass the configuration option from the module down to the nsd driver. And also ""not implented"" wrappers in nsd_gtls and nsd_ptcp drivers. Here is an older PR where I added ""streamdriver.permitexpiredcerts"" which you can use a template: 
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/pull/3366

For now I would also recommend too leave it with OCSP for now. If CRL becomes more important in future, it can be discussed again.

Btw., it would be great if we could get a testcase for OCSP. Do you have an idea how to do make one that works with a free and reliable OCSP service?

Ok, I'll look into introduce those knobs.

With respect to the default behavior: Wouldn't a user/operator expect that the TLS drivers perform such online revocation check by default, if the CA/PKI is including those? E.g. if someone hosts a TLS rsyslog server with a public CA vendor, the server gets compromised the  end-entity certificate of the server revoked by the CA. The OCSP server would know about the revoked certificate, the TLS rsyslog clients could then be ""protected"" talking to a compromised/revoked certificate. At least that would be my naive expectation that TLS client comply with: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6 /  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6.3
(which is referred by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5425#section-4.2.1 )


I understand that this might break existing deployments under certain circumstances. But on the long run I would encourage to perform online revocation checks if OCSP (or CRL) URL are embedded in the  end-entity or in the certificate path:

```
$ openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509 -text -noout | grep -A5 -E '(Authority Information Access|CRL Distribution Points)'
            X509v3 CRL Distribution Points: 

                Full Name:
                  URI:http://crl3.digicert.com/sha2-ha-server-g6.crl

                Full Name:
--
            Authority Information Access: 
                OCSP - URI:http://ocsp.digicert.com
                CA Issuers - URI:http://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertSHA2HighAssuranceServerCA.crt

            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
                CA:FALSE
```

This would not affect existing deployment using private PKI environment without any CRL/OCSP URL in the issued certificate.

Not sure if ""ignoring"" OCSP/CRL URLs as part of certificate validation would be categorized as https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/299.html

(Yes, the browsers don't do by default live online reovcation either IIUC, but they have some sort of regular caches updated transparently to the user. So there is at least some revocation checking going on)

On the long run OCSP stapling support would be obviously nice. The initial motivation for us implementing this was fulfilling some security requirements as syslog+TLS client, not as server. Not sure if there is on the market already a OCSP stapling aware syslog server. Maybe something worth to look into to add for rsyslog in future.

Sure, first you need to issue a set of certificates with a OCSP URI (Authority Information Access) included. To generate such testing purposes I build this: https://github.com/danos/vyatta-security-vpn/tree/master/docs/x509

I'll look into the existing rsyslog UTs if I can enhance/add something to existing ossl related UTs.

For development I used openssl as OCSP responder/server:
```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10
```

The index.txt is the file which openssl generates when you use OpenSSL to build a PKI. In this example the certificate for server13 got revoked. And `openssl ocsp -index indext.txt` basically uses that file as revocation database.

```
$ cat index.txt
V       191110011802Z           00      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=client1/emailAddress=client1+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
V       191110011816Z           01      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=serverA/emailAddress=serverA+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
R       191110011822Z   181110011831Z   02      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=server13/emailAddress=server13+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
```

To make use of OCSP nonces add `-nonce`:

```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10 -nonce
```


I haven't checked other free/open implementations yet. FreeIPA/dogtag PKI might be worth a look. But for self-contained UTs `openssl ocsp` might be sufficient I guess.

The only other detailed behavior change between different production OCSP responder/server deployments, which are easy to overlook if you just use `openssl ocsp`: the HTTP requests need to hold a ""Host"" header entry. Most or many public CA vendor seem to use CDN providers to guarantee their OCSP availability and responsiveness.

> With respect to the default behavior: Wouldn't a user/operator expect that the TLS drivers perform such online revocation check by default, if the CA/PKI is including those? E.g. if someone hosts a TLS rsyslog server with a public CA vendor, the server gets compromised the end-entity certificate of the server revoked by the CA. The OCSP server would know about the revoked certificate, the TLS rsyslog clients could then be ""protected"" talking to a compromised/revoked certificate.

Thanks for the details, @rgerhards I think under these circumstances it is save and reasonable to have OCSP checking enabled by default with the possibility to disable it if needed.

> On the long run OCSP stapling support would be obviously nice. The initial motivation for us implementing this was fulfilling some security requirements as syslog+TLS client, not as server. Not sure if there is on the market already a OCSP stapling aware syslog server.

Probably not yet ;).

For now I would also recommend too leave it with OCSP for now. If CRL becomes more important in future, it can be discussed again.

Btw., it would be great if we could get a testcase for OCSP. Do you have an idea how to do make one that works with a free and reliable OCSP service?

Ok, I'll look into introduce those knobs.

With respect to the default behavior: Wouldn't a user/operator expect that the TLS drivers perform such online revocation check by default, if the CA/PKI is including those? E.g. if someone hosts a TLS rsyslog server with a public CA vendor, the server gets compromised the  end-entity certificate of the server revoked by the CA. The OCSP server would know about the revoked certificate, the TLS rsyslog clients could then be ""protected"" talking to a compromised/revoked certificate. At least that would be my naive expectation that TLS client comply with: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6 /  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6.3
(which is referred by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5425#section-4.2.1 )


I understand that this might break existing deployments under certain circumstances. But on the long run I would encourage to perform online revocation checks if OCSP (or CRL) URL are embedded in the  end-entity or in the certificate path:

```
$ openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509 -text -noout | grep -A5 -E '(Authority Information Access|CRL Distribution Points)'
            X509v3 CRL Distribution Points: 

                Full Name:
                  URI:http://crl3.digicert.com/sha2-ha-server-g6.crl

                Full Name:
--
            Authority Information Access: 
                OCSP - URI:http://ocsp.digicert.com
                CA Issuers - URI:http://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertSHA2HighAssuranceServerCA.crt

            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
                CA:FALSE
```

This would not affect existing deployment using private PKI environment without any CRL/OCSP URL in the issued certificate.

Not sure if ""ignoring"" OCSP/CRL URLs as part of certificate validation would be categorized as https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/299.html

(Yes, the browsers don't do by default live online reovcation either IIUC, but they have some sort of regular caches updated transparently to the user. So there is at least some revocation checking going on)

On the long run OCSP stapling support would be obviously nice. The initial motivation for us implementing this was fulfilling some security requirements as syslog+TLS client, not as server. Not sure if there is on the market already a OCSP stapling aware syslog server. Maybe something worth to look into to add for rsyslog in future.

Sure, first you need to issue a set of certificates with a OCSP URI (Authority Information Access) included. To generate such testing purposes I build this: https://github.com/danos/vyatta-security-vpn/tree/master/docs/x509

I'll look into the existing rsyslog UTs if I can enhance/add something to existing ossl related UTs.

For development I used openssl as OCSP responder/server:
```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10
```

The index.txt is the file which openssl generates when you use OpenSSL to build a PKI. In this example the certificate for server13 got revoked. And `openssl ocsp -index indext.txt` basically uses that file as revocation database.

```
$ cat index.txt
V       191110011802Z           00      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=client1/emailAddress=client1+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
V       191110011816Z           01      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=serverA/emailAddress=serverA+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
R       191110011822Z   181110011831Z   02      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=server13/emailAddress=server13+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
```

To make use of OCSP nonces add `-nonce`:

```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10 -nonce
```


I haven't checked other free/open implementations yet. FreeIPA/dogtag PKI might be worth a look. But for self-contained UTs `openssl ocsp` might be sufficient I guess.

The only other detailed behavior change between different production OCSP responder/server deployments, which are easy to overlook if you just use `openssl ocsp`: the HTTP requests need to hold a ""Host"" header entry. Most or many public CA vendor seem to use CDN providers to guarantee their OCSP availability and responsiveness.

Thanks for the details, @rgerhards I think under these circumstances it is save and reasonable to have OCSP checking enabled by default with the possibility to disable it if needed.

That would be fully sufficient as ocsp server to build a testcase on. 
It just needs to be started in background and killed on shutdown. 
This needs some additional plumbing in diag.sh like done for this test here:
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_omsnmpv1_udp.sh
(See snmp_start_trapreceiver  and snmp_stop_trapreceiver )

If you create sample ca / certifcates based on your script, but make them last longer (Like 36500 days) which is ok for the testbench, add them to here for example (tests/testsuites/x.509), you can use these tests as template to build your own test on: 

https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_tls_certvalid.sh
(Just replace '$RS_TLS_DRIVER' with ossl, as this will only run for openssl). 
And this tests: 
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/imtcp-tls-ossl-basic.sh

You can run single tests manually when you build rsyslog like this:
- go to rsyslog source dir
- export srcdir=./
- autoreconf -vfi 
- ./configure ... your options ...
- make && make check 
- ...wait until first tests runs then break with CTRL + C
- cd tests
- ./yourtestcase.sh

Long time no see Daniel ;)

> @rgerhards , @alorbach , is there any trick to make Codacy happy with respect to the ""unknown"" SO_BINDTODEVICE value?

I think this issue is a false positive and can be ignored. 
I have commented above on the other issue. 

Indeed, pretty long time :)

Pushed a bio==NULL variant.

Let's see if that passes codacy.


Do you have any preference or suggestion on additional configuration knobs?

I guess a knob to turn of all certificate revocation checks off would probably be helpful, to mimic the previous behavior. Personally I would prefer if (online) revocation checks would be done by default, which might be expected by some TLS users.

I could contribute online CRL support as well, but that is rather complex, with delta-CRLs and such things. And not sure if online CRLs has really a future. Most or all public CAs do OCSP today, might be also a CAB Forum requirement (haven't checked). Letsencrypt does OCSP-only. So I wonder if online CRL is worth the burden.

No luck with codacy:

   `Condition 'bio==NULL' is always false`

> No luck with codacy:

@rgerhards do you see the reason why this is detected as issue?

Yes indeed I would recommend to have configuration options in imtcp and omfwd enabling  / disabling OCSP checking with default OFF to maintain existing behavior. 
With a name like ""StreamDriver.TlsVerifyOcsp"" (See other TLS Options in imtcp/omfwd doc): 
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/imtcp.html
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/omfwd.html

You needs some additional coding to pass the configuration option from the module down to the nsd driver. And also ""not implented"" wrappers in nsd_gtls and nsd_ptcp drivers. Here is an older PR where I added ""streamdriver.permitexpiredcerts"" which you can use a template: 
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/pull/3366

That would be fully sufficient as ocsp server to build a testcase on. 
It just needs to be started in background and killed on shutdown. 
This needs some additional plumbing in diag.sh like done for this test here:
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_omsnmpv1_udp.sh
(See snmp_start_trapreceiver  and snmp_stop_trapreceiver )

If you create sample ca / certifcates based on your script, but make them last longer (Like 36500 days) which is ok for the testbench, add them to here for example (tests/testsuites/x.509), you can use these tests as template to build your own test on: 

https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_tls_certvalid.sh
(Just replace '$RS_TLS_DRIVER' with ossl, as this will only run for openssl). 
And this tests: 
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/imtcp-tls-ossl-basic.sh

You can run single tests manually when you build rsyslog like this:
- go to rsyslog source dir
- export srcdir=./
- autoreconf -vfi 
- ./configure ... your options ...
- make && make check 
- ...wait until first tests runs then break with CTRL + C
- cd tests
- ./yourtestcase.sh

I guess a knob to turn of all certificate revocation checks off would probably be helpful, to mimic the previous behavior. Personally I would prefer if (online) revocation checks would be done by default, which might be expected by some TLS users.

I could contribute online CRL support as well, but that is rather complex, with delta-CRLs and such things. And not sure if online CRLs has really a future. Most or all public CAs do OCSP today, might be also a CAB Forum requirement (haven't checked). Letsencrypt does OCSP-only. So I wonder if online CRL is worth the burden.

No luck with codacy:

   `Condition 'bio==NULL' is always false`

Yes indeed I would recommend to have configuration options in imtcp and omfwd enabling  / disabling OCSP checking with default OFF to maintain existing behavior. 
With a name like ""StreamDriver.TlsVerifyOcsp"" (See other TLS Options in imtcp/omfwd doc): 
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/imtcp.html
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/omfwd.html

You needs some additional coding to pass the configuration option from the module down to the nsd driver. And also ""not implented"" wrappers in nsd_gtls and nsd_ptcp drivers. Here is an older PR where I added ""streamdriver.permitexpiredcerts"" which you can use a template: 
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/pull/3366

For now I would also recommend too leave it with OCSP for now. If CRL becomes more important in future, it can be discussed again.

Btw., it would be great if we could get a testcase for OCSP. Do you have an idea how to do make one that works with a free and reliable OCSP service?

Ok, I'll look into introduce those knobs.

With respect to the default behavior: Wouldn't a user/operator expect that the TLS drivers perform such online revocation check by default, if the CA/PKI is including those? E.g. if someone hosts a TLS rsyslog server with a public CA vendor, the server gets compromised the  end-entity certificate of the server revoked by the CA. The OCSP server would know about the revoked certificate, the TLS rsyslog clients could then be ""protected"" talking to a compromised/revoked certificate. At least that would be my naive expectation that TLS client comply with: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6 /  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6.3
(which is referred by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5425#section-4.2.1 )


I understand that this might break existing deployments under certain circumstances. But on the long run I would encourage to perform online revocation checks if OCSP (or CRL) URL are embedded in the  end-entity or in the certificate path:

```
$ openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509 -text -noout | grep -A5 -E '(Authority Information Access|CRL Distribution Points)'
            X509v3 CRL Distribution Points: 

                Full Name:
                  URI:http://crl3.digicert.com/sha2-ha-server-g6.crl

                Full Name:
--
            Authority Information Access: 
                OCSP - URI:http://ocsp.digicert.com
                CA Issuers - URI:http://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertSHA2HighAssuranceServerCA.crt

            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
                CA:FALSE
```

This would not affect existing deployment using private PKI environment without any CRL/OCSP URL in the issued certificate.

Not sure if ""ignoring"" OCSP/CRL URLs as part of certificate validation would be categorized as https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/299.html

(Yes, the browsers don't do by default live online reovcation either IIUC, but they have some sort of regular caches updated transparently to the user. So there is at least some revocation checking going on)

On the long run OCSP stapling support would be obviously nice. The initial motivation for us implementing this was fulfilling some security requirements as syslog+TLS client, not as server. Not sure if there is on the market already a OCSP stapling aware syslog server. Maybe something worth to look into to add for rsyslog in future.

Sure, first you need to issue a set of certificates with a OCSP URI (Authority Information Access) included. To generate such testing purposes I build this: https://github.com/danos/vyatta-security-vpn/tree/master/docs/x509

I'll look into the existing rsyslog UTs if I can enhance/add something to existing ossl related UTs.

For development I used openssl as OCSP responder/server:
```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10
```

The index.txt is the file which openssl generates when you use OpenSSL to build a PKI. In this example the certificate for server13 got revoked. And `openssl ocsp -index indext.txt` basically uses that file as revocation database.

```
$ cat index.txt
V       191110011802Z           00      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=client1/emailAddress=client1+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
V       191110011816Z           01      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=serverA/emailAddress=serverA+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
R       191110011822Z   181110011831Z   02      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=server13/emailAddress=server13+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
```

To make use of OCSP nonces add `-nonce`:

```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10 -nonce
```


I haven't checked other free/open implementations yet. FreeIPA/dogtag PKI might be worth a look. But for self-contained UTs `openssl ocsp` might be sufficient I guess.

The only other detailed behavior change between different production OCSP responder/server deployments, which are easy to overlook if you just use `openssl ocsp`: the HTTP requests need to hold a ""Host"" header entry. Most or many public CA vendor seem to use CDN providers to guarantee their OCSP availability and responsiveness.

> With respect to the default behavior: Wouldn't a user/operator expect that the TLS drivers perform such online revocation check by default, if the CA/PKI is including those? E.g. if someone hosts a TLS rsyslog server with a public CA vendor, the server gets compromised the end-entity certificate of the server revoked by the CA. The OCSP server would know about the revoked certificate, the TLS rsyslog clients could then be ""protected"" talking to a compromised/revoked certificate.

Thanks for the details, @rgerhards I think under these circumstances it is save and reasonable to have OCSP checking enabled by default with the possibility to disable it if needed.

> On the long run OCSP stapling support would be obviously nice. The initial motivation for us implementing this was fulfilling some security requirements as syslog+TLS client, not as server. Not sure if there is on the market already a OCSP stapling aware syslog server.

Probably not yet ;).

For now I would also recommend too leave it with OCSP for now. If CRL becomes more important in future, it can be discussed again.

Btw., it would be great if we could get a testcase for OCSP. Do you have an idea how to do make one that works with a free and reliable OCSP service?

Ok, I'll look into introduce those knobs.

With respect to the default behavior: Wouldn't a user/operator expect that the TLS drivers perform such online revocation check by default, if the CA/PKI is including those? E.g. if someone hosts a TLS rsyslog server with a public CA vendor, the server gets compromised the  end-entity certificate of the server revoked by the CA. The OCSP server would know about the revoked certificate, the TLS rsyslog clients could then be ""protected"" talking to a compromised/revoked certificate. At least that would be my naive expectation that TLS client comply with: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6 /  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6.3
(which is referred by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5425#section-4.2.1 )


I understand that this might break existing deployments under certain circumstances. But on the long run I would encourage to perform online revocation checks if OCSP (or CRL) URL are embedded in the  end-entity or in the certificate path:

```
$ openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509 -text -noout | grep -A5 -E '(Authority Information Access|CRL Distribution Points)'
            X509v3 CRL Distribution Points: 

                Full Name:
                  URI:http://crl3.digicert.com/sha2-ha-server-g6.crl

                Full Name:
--
            Authority Information Access: 
                OCSP - URI:http://ocsp.digicert.com
                CA Issuers - URI:http://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertSHA2HighAssuranceServerCA.crt

            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
                CA:FALSE
```

This would not affect existing deployment using private PKI environment without any CRL/OCSP URL in the issued certificate.

Not sure if ""ignoring"" OCSP/CRL URLs as part of certificate validation would be categorized as https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/299.html

(Yes, the browsers don't do by default live online reovcation either IIUC, but they have some sort of regular caches updated transparently to the user. So there is at least some revocation checking going on)

On the long run OCSP stapling support would be obviously nice. The initial motivation for us implementing this was fulfilling some security requirements as syslog+TLS client, not as server. Not sure if there is on the market already a OCSP stapling aware syslog server. Maybe something worth to look into to add for rsyslog in future.

Sure, first you need to issue a set of certificates with a OCSP URI (Authority Information Access) included. To generate such testing purposes I build this: https://github.com/danos/vyatta-security-vpn/tree/master/docs/x509

I'll look into the existing rsyslog UTs if I can enhance/add something to existing ossl related UTs.

For development I used openssl as OCSP responder/server:
```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10
```

The index.txt is the file which openssl generates when you use OpenSSL to build a PKI. In this example the certificate for server13 got revoked. And `openssl ocsp -index indext.txt` basically uses that file as revocation database.

```
$ cat index.txt
V       191110011802Z           00      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=client1/emailAddress=client1+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
V       191110011816Z           01      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=serverA/emailAddress=serverA+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
R       191110011822Z   181110011831Z   02      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=server13/emailAddress=server13+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
```

To make use of OCSP nonces add `-nonce`:

```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10 -nonce
```


I haven't checked other free/open implementations yet. FreeIPA/dogtag PKI might be worth a look. But for self-contained UTs `openssl ocsp` might be sufficient I guess.

The only other detailed behavior change between different production OCSP responder/server deployments, which are easy to overlook if you just use `openssl ocsp`: the HTTP requests need to hold a ""Host"" header entry. Most or many public CA vendor seem to use CDN providers to guarantee their OCSP availability and responsiveness.

Thanks for the details, @rgerhards I think under these circumstances it is save and reasonable to have OCSP checking enabled by default with the possibility to disable it if needed.

That would be fully sufficient as ocsp server to build a testcase on. 
It just needs to be started in background and killed on shutdown. 
This needs some additional plumbing in diag.sh like done for this test here:
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_omsnmpv1_udp.sh
(See snmp_start_trapreceiver  and snmp_stop_trapreceiver )

If you create sample ca / certifcates based on your script, but make them last longer (Like 36500 days) which is ok for the testbench, add them to here for example (tests/testsuites/x.509), you can use these tests as template to build your own test on: 

https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_tls_certvalid.sh
(Just replace '$RS_TLS_DRIVER' with ossl, as this will only run for openssl). 
And this tests: 
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/imtcp-tls-ossl-basic.sh

You can run single tests manually when you build rsyslog like this:
- go to rsyslog source dir
- export srcdir=./
- autoreconf -vfi 
- ./configure ... your options ...
- make && make check 
- ...wait until first tests runs then break with CTRL + C
- cd tests
- ./yourtestcase.sh

Long time no see Daniel ;)

> @rgerhards , @alorbach , is there any trick to make Codacy happy with respect to the ""unknown"" SO_BINDTODEVICE value?

I think this issue is a false positive and can be ignored. 
I have commented above on the other issue. 

Indeed, pretty long time :)

Pushed a bio==NULL variant.

Let's see if that passes codacy.


Do you have any preference or suggestion on additional configuration knobs?

I guess a knob to turn of all certificate revocation checks off would probably be helpful, to mimic the previous behavior. Personally I would prefer if (online) revocation checks would be done by default, which might be expected by some TLS users.

I could contribute online CRL support as well, but that is rather complex, with delta-CRLs and such things. And not sure if online CRLs has really a future. Most or all public CAs do OCSP today, might be also a CAB Forum requirement (haven't checked). Letsencrypt does OCSP-only. So I wonder if online CRL is worth the burden.

No luck with codacy:

   `Condition 'bio==NULL' is always false`

> No luck with codacy:

@rgerhards do you see the reason why this is detected as issue?

Yes indeed I would recommend to have configuration options in imtcp and omfwd enabling  / disabling OCSP checking with default OFF to maintain existing behavior. 
With a name like ""StreamDriver.TlsVerifyOcsp"" (See other TLS Options in imtcp/omfwd doc): 
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/imtcp.html
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/omfwd.html

You needs some additional coding to pass the configuration option from the module down to the nsd driver. And also ""not implented"" wrappers in nsd_gtls and nsd_ptcp drivers. Here is an older PR where I added ""streamdriver.permitexpiredcerts"" which you can use a template: 
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/pull/3366

That would be fully sufficient as ocsp server to build a testcase on. 
It just needs to be started in background and killed on shutdown. 
This needs some additional plumbing in diag.sh like done for this test here:
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_omsnmpv1_udp.sh
(See snmp_start_trapreceiver  and snmp_stop_trapreceiver )

If you create sample ca / certifcates based on your script, but make them last longer (Like 36500 days) which is ok for the testbench, add them to here for example (tests/testsuites/x.509), you can use these tests as template to build your own test on: 

https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/sndrcv_tls_certvalid.sh
(Just replace '$RS_TLS_DRIVER' with ossl, as this will only run for openssl). 
And this tests: 
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/blob/master/tests/imtcp-tls-ossl-basic.sh

You can run single tests manually when you build rsyslog like this:
- go to rsyslog source dir
- export srcdir=./
- autoreconf -vfi 
- ./configure ... your options ...
- make && make check 
- ...wait until first tests runs then break with CTRL + C
- cd tests
- ./yourtestcase.sh

Long time no see Daniel ;)

> @rgerhards , @alorbach , is there any trick to make Codacy happy with respect to the ""unknown"" SO_BINDTODEVICE value?

I think this issue is a false positive and can be ignored. 
I have commented above on the other issue. 

Indeed, pretty long time :)

Pushed a bio==NULL variant.

Let's see if that passes codacy.


Do you have any preference or suggestion on additional configuration knobs?

I guess a knob to turn of all certificate revocation checks off would probably be helpful, to mimic the previous behavior. Personally I would prefer if (online) revocation checks would be done by default, which might be expected by some TLS users.

I could contribute online CRL support as well, but that is rather complex, with delta-CRLs and such things. And not sure if online CRLs has really a future. Most or all public CAs do OCSP today, might be also a CAB Forum requirement (haven't checked). Letsencrypt does OCSP-only. So I wonder if online CRL is worth the burden.

No luck with codacy:

   `Condition 'bio==NULL' is always false`

> No luck with codacy:

@rgerhards do you see the reason why this is detected as issue?

Yes indeed I would recommend to have configuration options in imtcp and omfwd enabling  / disabling OCSP checking with default OFF to maintain existing behavior. 
With a name like ""StreamDriver.TlsVerifyOcsp"" (See other TLS Options in imtcp/omfwd doc): 
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/imtcp.html
https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/modules/omfwd.html

You needs some additional coding to pass the configuration option from the module down to the nsd driver. And also ""not implented"" wrappers in nsd_gtls and nsd_ptcp drivers. Here is an older PR where I added ""streamdriver.permitexpiredcerts"" which you can use a template:

For now I would also recommend too leave it with OCSP for now. If CRL becomes more important in future, it can be discussed again.

Btw., it would be great if we could get a testcase for OCSP. Do you have an idea how to do make one that works with a free and reliable OCSP service?

Ok, I'll look into introduce those knobs.

With respect to the default behavior: Wouldn't a user/operator expect that the TLS drivers perform such online revocation check by default, if the CA/PKI is including those? E.g. if someone hosts a TLS rsyslog server with a public CA vendor, the server gets compromised the  end-entity certificate of the server revoked by the CA. The OCSP server would know about the revoked certificate, the TLS rsyslog clients could then be ""protected"" talking to a compromised/revoked certificate. At least that would be my naive expectation that TLS client comply with: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6 /  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6.3
(which is referred by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5425#section-4.2.1 )


I understand that this might break existing deployments under certain circumstances. But on the long run I would encourage to perform online revocation checks if OCSP (or CRL) URL are embedded in the  end-entity or in the certificate path:

```
$ openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509 -text -noout | grep -A5 -E '(Authority Information Access|CRL Distribution Points)'
            X509v3 CRL Distribution Points: 

                Full Name:
                  URI:http://crl3.digicert.com/sha2-ha-server-g6.crl

                Full Name:
--
            Authority Information Access: 
                OCSP - URI:http://ocsp.digicert.com
                CA Issuers - URI:http://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertSHA2HighAssuranceServerCA.crt

            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
                CA:FALSE
```

This would not affect existing deployment using private PKI environment without any CRL/OCSP URL in the issued certificate.

Not sure if ""ignoring"" OCSP/CRL URLs as part of certificate validation would be categorized as https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/299.html

(Yes, the browsers don't do by default live online reovcation either IIUC, but they have some sort of regular caches updated transparently to the user. So there is at least some revocation checking going on)

On the long run OCSP stapling support would be obviously nice. The initial motivation for us implementing this was fulfilling some security requirements as syslog+TLS client, not as server. Not sure if there is on the market already a OCSP stapling aware syslog server. Maybe something worth to look into to add for rsyslog in future.

Sure, first you need to issue a set of certificates with a OCSP URI (Authority Information Access) included. To generate such testing purposes I build this: https://github.com/danos/vyatta-security-vpn/tree/master/docs/x509

I'll look into the existing rsyslog UTs if I can enhance/add something to existing ossl related UTs.

For development I used openssl as OCSP responder/server:
```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10
```

The index.txt is the file which openssl generates when you use OpenSSL to build a PKI. In this example the certificate for server13 got revoked. And `openssl ocsp -index indext.txt` basically uses that file as revocation database.

```
$ cat index.txt
V       191110011802Z           00      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=client1/emailAddress=client1+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
V       191110011816Z           01      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=serverA/emailAddress=serverA+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
R       191110011822Z   181110011831Z   02      unknown /C=US/ST=CA/O=AT&T/OU=Labs/CN=server13/emailAddress=server13+rsa@vyatta.att-mail.com
```

To make use of OCSP nonces add `-nonce`:

```
openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner RSA_ocsp1.pem -rkey RSA_ocsp1.key -CA RSA_CA.pem -text -nmin 10 -nonce
```


I haven't checked other free/open implementations yet. FreeIPA/dogtag PKI might be worth a look. But for self-contained UTs `openssl ocsp` might be sufficient I guess.

The only other detailed behavior change between different production OCSP responder/server deployments, which are easy to overlook if you just use `openssl ocsp`: the HTTP requests need to hold a ""Host"" header entry. Most or many public CA vendor seem to use CDN providers to guarantee their OCSP availability and responsiveness.

> With respect to the default behavior: Wouldn't a user/operator expect that the TLS drivers perform such online revocation check by default, if the CA/PKI is including those? E.g. if someone hosts a TLS rsyslog server with a public CA vendor, the server gets compromised the end-entity certificate of the server revoked by the CA. The OCSP server would know about the revoked certificate, the TLS rsyslog clients could then be ""protected"" talking to a compromised/revoked certificate.

Thanks for the details, @rgerhards I think under these circumstances it is save and reasonable to have OCSP checking enabled by default with the possibility to disable it if needed.

> On the long run OCSP stapling support would be obviously nice. The initial motivation for us implementing this was fulfilling some security requirements as syslog+TLS client, not as server. Not sure if there is on the market already a OCSP stapling aware syslog server.

Probably not yet ;).

This logger method can be used generally for creating any user, and we could need to show an ERROR log in other places.

Would be better to create a new logger method only for creating admin. Moreover, it would be good to mention something like ""skipping creation of the admin"" as it describes more INFO about the event as it's expected. WDYT?




@sjweixel Thanks for the contribution!

I wonder why we need this message. The error is that the user exists, not that it is not assigned an admin role.

I would maybe suggest a different approach for this PR. We could create a separate log message as suggested by @mabartos (something like `addAdminUserFailedAdminExists` maybe) and use it just in `KeycloakMain` without modifying `ApplienceBootstrap`.

Thanks for updating the PR! I believe the comment above is still valid.

I'm not clear on the comment.  The code in ApplianceBootStrap is testing if the user exists and if so, determines if the admin role is assigned to the user.

```
        if (existingUser != null) {
            RoleModel adminRole = realm.getRole(AdminRoles.ADMIN);
            if (existingUser.hasRole(adminRole)) {
               ServicesLogger.LOGGER.addAdminUserUserExists(username, Config.getAdminRealm());
            } else {
               ServicesLogger.LOGGER.userNotAssignedRole(username, Config.getAdminRealm(), AdminRoles.ADMIN);
            }
            return;
        }
```
Is your comment addressing one of these concerns?
- The log message about the role doesn't match the logic in the code.
- The change doesn't match the issue as it is described.
- This message has no value.

The initial issue that I opened was #16961.  It was closed as a duplicate of this issue, then reopened after my initial PR.  One of my concerns is that when KEYCLOAK_ADMIN is used to specify a user, an admin user isn't created if that username already exists without admin role.  This may not be a situation that occurs often.   I think it could the user some headache if the situation arises.  

@vmuzikar.  Please explain your comment about changing code in KeycloakMain instead of ApplianceBootstrap.  I'm not certhan that what you are suggesting is possible.  The code that currently checks for existing users and generates error log is in ApplianceBootstrap.  If user exists check and log message is added to KeycloakMain, then ApplianceBootrap will need also need to be modified to remove existing user check and log message.

IMHO, this part of the code is valid and should not be removed. No user should be present in the DB within bootstrapping, and only the initial admin account should be created. With the suggested changes, we can create multiple admins via ENV vars, which is not what we want. The other admins should be created only via the admin console and not via ENV vars.

My PR was indented for issue #16961, which was closed as a duplicate of #15789 at the time the PR was created.  Issue #16961 has since been reopened and I will move my PR to that issue.  ENV vars should create an admin specified even if another admin exists.  It is the only way to recover if new admin deletes the initial admin account/revokes the initial user's admin role or if the initial admin username/password is somehow lost.   In older versions of Keycloak, the ENV would create a new admin user regardless of the existence of other admin users.   This was extremely helpful because it also made Keycloak recovery from backup database possible.  If a Keycloak instance is wiped out, but a database backup exists, you can recover without knowing initial admin credentials, because a new admin account could be created with ENVs.  I strongly believe there needs to be a way to create an admin account in the event that someone loses initial admin password.

@sjweixel I understand your use case, and thanks for bringing this up! Still, I'd strongly recommend joining a discussion related to this topic (https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/8549). I'm afraid that this topic requires broader debate regarding the admin access recovery.

Could you please try to summarize your needs and proposed solution to the mentioned discussion? Thanks

ok, so this verifies that all of the output is the same if you add the keys caps; but i think we also want to test that we *don't* see keys if we're missing that cap. i think that means we need to create a separate `Assistant Admin User` with only the user caps?

ok, so you changed this to match what was documented in adminops.rst? this is still a potentially-breaking change for users, so should at least be mentioned in PendingReleaseNotes

we might also consider making this backward-compatible, by looking for a `""secret-key""` parameter if we don't find one called `""secret""`

i wish we could do all of these checks in `check_caps()` like `RGWOp_User_Create` and `RGWOp_Subuser_Create` do, but i see that the checks depend on params like `gen_secret` that we don't know until we get to `execute()`

i think we should return *any* error from `check_cap()`, not just `-EPERM`. ex:
```c++
  int r = caps.check_cap(""users"", RGW_CAP_WRITE);
  if (r < 0) {
    return r;
  }
  return caps.check_cap(""keys"", RGW_CAP_WRITE);
```

Though this is out of scope for this PR I noticed that both of the keys needed to be included in a create new key request or else the operation would not go through. I get a `InvalidSecretKey` and `InvalidAccessKeyID` when either are empty in a request.

similar comment about not checking for `-EPERM` specifically. you can also consider combining these two with something like:
```c++
  // require ""keys=write"" cap to generate or modify secret_key
  if (gen_secret || !secret_key.empty()) {
    op_ret = s->user->get_info().caps.check_cap(""keys"", RGW_CAP_WRITE);
    if (op_ret < 0) {
      return;
    }
  }
```

this needs to check the caps of the same `s->user` that sent the request; that's not necessarily the same user we're dumping the info for - an admin user could call `RGWOp_User_Info` with any value for `""uid""`

i think each `Op::execute()` function should do that `check_cap(""keys"", RGW_CAP_READ)` against `s->user`, and pass a `bool dump_keys` through functions like `RGWUserAdminOp_User::info()` to control whether we dump keys here

@cbodley do you think it would be worth documenting what each of these caps does at a high level in the docs? There's nothing like that so far, though in the admin api does reference which caps are necessary for certain operations.

if the adminapi docs are consistent about showing the required caps, i think that's probably all the documentation we need

@cbodley What would you think about removing these parameter specific checks and just having the op (in this instance modify user) return -EPERM if `keys` are not set to `write` in `check_caps` just like I'm doing in `RGWOp_User_Create`. `RGWOp_Subuser_Modify` is another example of this. This would only apply to parameter checks for the cap `RGW_CAP_WRITE` not `RGW_CAP_READ`.

Yup, I'm going to be adding those tests at the end of the file. I wanted to just get the PR out there and make sure that this tests passes with the new caps on a locked teuthology machine before I start adding more to this test file.

I like the idea of checking for the `secret-key` parameter to ensure backward compatibility .

Yes, I'd be fine with that for ops that require `keys=write`, I just mentioned this below https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/50313#discussion_r1120780347

we shouldn't prevent someone with `user=write` caps from modifying other fields of the user info. you're generally doing the right thing with these parameter-specific checks

i wish we could do that in the `check_caps()` function, but it's not really worth restructuring all of these ops in order to parse their params before `verify_permissions()`/`check_caps()`

@cbodley I determined the value of `dump_keys`  from the `op_state` here. Was that the right thing to do? I don't know which code paths exercise this `RGWUserAdminOp_User::create()` so I'm not sure if there is an `req_state` somewhere up the call stack.

@alimaredia i think it's right, but nothing uses this `RGWUserCreateCR` class after @yuvalif removed pubsub in https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/48996. i'd rather remove the class entirely than continue to maintain it

I don't usually like JS but this is pretty, nice one!

the data-toggle and data-target trigger the modal pop up to display, I could make so that there is a listener for these buttons instead but that seems to add unnecessary js code.

the username here used for authentication with mailchimp api  is completely optional so I just added something random.

Added comment in latest push. I hope it helps 

Thanks so much for the comment, super informative and saves some stack overflow trawling.

Thanks for clarifying on that, agree it's preferable to a listener, however I was questioning what the effect will be - is it so that when someone clicks ""Open in Gmail"" they get a popup asking them to subscribe to the mailing list? Because that doesn't seem ideal and wouldn't capture people on mobile (for whom these buttons don't show, but make up a large chunk of the users).

@rafeeJ since you've tried it out perhaps you could address this concern? otherwise very happy to approve it for staging

Consider refactoring to make the helper function `is_input_valid` and `is_parameter_found` a single function `get_model` that gets a single Task instance or raises an exception. Then in your route function, you can appropriately handle the exception by returning a 400 or 404.

We do not need to create an empty dictionary first.

```suggestion
    response_body = task.to_dict()
```

As above, we do not need an empty dictionary.
```suggestion
    response_body[""goal""] = new_goal.to_dict()
```

Nice work adding this feature!

This part of the function doesn't quite do what you are looking for. I noticed you handled this in your routes by creating a separate response body that takes the `task_ids` from the response body. This is a good choice. You could also refactor this method to get the appropriate task_ids 
```suggestion
            return {
                ""id"": self.goal_id,
                ""task_ids"": [task.task_id for task in self.tasks]
```

What are these lines doing? Consider whether they are needed.

Great work creating the correct response dictionary for the different situations. Consider how you could DRY up your code by first determining whether `""is_complete""` should be `True` or `False`

We also want assertions to check that the `response_body` is what we're looking for.

As a full for loop

```
task_ids = []
for task in self.tasks:
    task_ids.append(task.id)

Such as className, required, placeholder, etc.? Many fields have these properties so it'd be nice if they aren't repeated.

You could pull out the fields that don't match the ""Field"" prop types and then just use the spread operator for the rest. eg. `{errorTextInput, ...rest}` then `<Field component={errorTextInput} {...rest}/>`.

I think that's the syntax for the spread, I'm doing this without a linter so you'll have to let me know.

These can probably be migrated too, right?

`{this.showInstitutionBox}` seems hacky as well?

🤔 

Does this require the empty blocks? I guess because it needs to be a React component to pass the type checking?

I thought about it, but I think the real intent behind this refactor is to remove the nested function calls to make things more composable, didn't see a real use for ""display components"" to be migrated away as yet

I agree that's the major selling point of this refactor, but having a `createXYZ` function that generates a component is basically just a constructor of a stateless component with extra steps and less readability.

Yes! We are passing in `Why Do you want to attend {event.name}?` to `ApplicationLabel`, and the use of `{event.name}` requires the surrounding text to be a React node - so I wrapped it in a Fragment, which is the intended use case anyway.

Oh good point! I forgot I was going to let the base inherit from JSX.InstrisicTypes (or whatever it's called) and pass the props down to allow things like aria tags to get on the fields

ARIA fields 😮 Are we GDPR compliant as well? 😆

Better to keep this in the original format, since we've seen it changed once and can expect it to change again. If you want to use the dict-ified format, process the original with a function as below in a new `_real_initialize()` method. Or use the logic that I suggested with the format as-is.

**Or**, as below, get the map from the page and then you don't need to change the hard-wired copy here: in fact in that case you could argue that, since the JS Array has been in the page apparently forever, if it's no longer there the page structure is likely to have changed in a way that isn't handled just by having an old copy, and so there's no point having a default at all, except to document what we expected to find.

The page JS is using this (actually probably not since the page code is wrong), supposing that the part before `/i/` is the stream format for the `arch` row of the map:
```suggestion
            'https://ussenate-f.akamaihd.net/i/%s.mp4/master.m3u8' % video_id,

```

This contribution raises interesting questions about the ""Languages & Frameworks"" section.

- Initially, the section was meant to indeed provide how-to guides for common languages and frameworks.
- When we had covered most languages, and started adding frameworks, it was confusing to mix frameworks with languages (e.g. a list like ""C++, Ruby, Java, Pandas"" doesn't make sense, because you're mixing languages and non-languages). So we decided to merge the frameworks into their specific language page (i.e. merge ""Pandas"" into the ""Python"" guide)
- However, the ""Firebase"" framework is not strongly related to one particular language, is it?

I still find it confusing to mix frameworks with languages, but we also can't merge Firebase into an existing language guide.

Maybe we should indeed have separate ""Languages"" and ""Frameworks"" sub-menus? Also, Firebase isn't even a ""framework"". Maybe it's more like a ""tool"", or ""technology""? (Same goes for databases and such). So maybe let's have ""Languages"" and ""Tools"" sub-menus?

`postgres` or `postgresql` ? 

`postgres`

It is an alias, while `postgresql` is a databaseKind. We need to use the alias as CocroachDB and PostgreSQL have the same databaseKind and we need to distinguish between them.

`postgres` should IMO remain, but default value should be updated in the next commit.

`postgres` should IMO remain, but default value should be updated in the next commit.

I'm not sure what `spi` you have in mind here, could you please elaborate on this?

The intention was to make easy use of methods `isEnabledOnLegacyStore` and `isEnabledOnNewStore` on filters. E.g.:

https://github.com/vramik/keycloak/blob/d760d18dbec0317f48bd43a8c9b6a775384e2dcd/quarkus/config-api/src/main/java/org/keycloak/config/database/Database.java#L115

I mean keep the convention around mapping these properties to some with prefix `kc.spi-`.
```suggestion
                        .to(""kc.spi-map-storage-jpa-db"")
                        .mapFrom(""storage"")
```

Thanks for the explanation. I see the help message was changed, and it makes sense to me right now.

Ok. It's just a nitpick and should not block this PR.

AFAIK this should be a valid Hibernate class name. As there is no `CockroachDialect`, I'm suggesting as the most recent dialect supported in Hibernate 5.x.

At the same time, this is in the Quarkus 2.x branch not used, as we'll override it for the new store with the `JsonbPostgreSQL95Dialect`, so this explains why the tests are green.

```suggestion
                ""org.hibernate.dialect.CockroachDB201Dialect"",
```

Thanks, for pointing that out. You're right, the `CockroachDialect` is supported since Hibernate 6. I'll make sure it's reflected in https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/16549

Made a comment for this: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/16549#issuecomment-1457954652

I have a bit silly question. Why do we even need this new option? :) Can't we simply piggyback on `--db`?

I understand that this is a new Store option. But what will happen with the `--db` after the new Store replaces the legacy Store? Would we keep using `--storage-jpa-db`? Isn't it a bit long? :)

@vramik I believe even with an `Enum` this would be achievable, if I'm not mistaken, so @mabartos has a valid point. But it's just a nitpick, non-blocking from my side.

Just out of curiosity, why to make this change?

During work on this issue it was discovered that with JTA always enabled for the new store we should always XA driver. Would you prefer to open rather separate PR with this change extracted from here to make it more visible/trackable?

At this moment there is a difference in ""expected values' as well as in ""default value"" between `--db` and `--storage-jpa-db`. 

That's the reason it was introduced in the first place. 

I agree that after the new Store replaces the legacy Store it might be a bit long :) 

note: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/13562 

The two options have a different set of possible values. All storage options are considered preview anyway, so I'm ok with having an extra option for now. Once we have per-realm-configuration of storages, this will soon look very different anyway.

Makes sense.

No problem, let's keep it here.

This is good. Is there a reason for using function based view instead of class based?

I've started with function based views rather than class based as this emulates the Flask app behaviour so should ease the everyone's transition to the Django way of doing things.

Ah okay, makes sense!

Sorry I missed this, but should we not change to a different database than sqlite3 unless the speed is not an issue for the api calls.

Yeah we can do, I have no previous database experience so happy to hear any opinions on this. @behradkoohy is a fan of PostgreSQL right?

Yeah, PostgreSQL is good too! Do you guys think there would be read heavy api's in this project though? That would be the only reason to not use PostgreSQL over MySQL. Otherwise, I don't see a reason not to use it.

In most cases, we can also implement both for different cases like so:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'NAME': 'main_data',
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'USER': 'postgres_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'abcde'

    'users': {

        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'USER': 'mysql_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'abcde'
    }
}
```

but I don't think this application/project warrants such an implementation.

There's a lot of similar code around this. Refactor by adding class vars

    _FORMAT_OBJECT_URL_TMPL = '{0}/api/videofile.php?video_id={1}'
```
And then override those in derived classes as necessary, so that these base class methods can be used directly by derived classes (except where they can't ... but I think all the derived class methods are identical once this transformation is applied):
```suggestion
    def _download_info_object(self, video_id):
        return self._download_json(

```suggestion
            'https://{0}{1}&f=video.m3u8'.format(

Or discard `_get_video_host()` with the proposed refactor:
```suggestion
            '{0}{1}&f=video.m3u8'.format(
                self._BASE_URL,
```

This will never happen because `_sort_formats()` will raise if its formats list is empty.

If this fallback is wanted, make running `_sort_formats()` conditional and provide a test where the fallback is used.

My linter keeps telling me that it should be constants because they never get changed. So i just accepted it's requests this time. However i think we might need some general consensus on these thngs so that the code stays uniform. Either all Lets or const if they don;t get reassigned.

thank you!

I will look into this


That seems to be the correct way of doing this, so i will change it.

This certainly can be reverted, but afaik `LibraryFolderDatabaseIdField` is not directly related to FastAPI, it is part of the schema module which managers already depend on. I thought the idea was to completely get rid of the manual encoding/decoding scattered across the entire code base and especially the managers and deal with it at the API layer so managers work always with simple integers.

But I agree this particular case was just a naive attempt to reduce manual handling of the `F` encoding for folders, but ideally, there will be no encoding at all here.

We don't need to check here if we have a goal. The call to `valid_id` on line 50 will throw a 404 if the goal doesn't exist, so we're guaranteed to have something valid if we make it down here.

Nice use of escaping to include quote literals in your string.

Gorgeous!

Nice job re-using the task ids from the request instead of having to remake them yourself.

👍🏻

Nice docstring! However, when you're doing triple quotes, you don't need to include backslashes for multi-line strings.

Most of this if/else block is the same between the two conditions. Can you think of a way to condense your code here so that most of the logic is shared, and the if/else only handles the difference between the `goal_id` being included or not?

This definitely works well! Can you think of what this would look like as a list comprehension instead. Either is good, it's just a matter of personal preference~

You could consider combining these two lines into one:
```
tasks_dict = {
    ""task"": new_task.to_dict()
}
```

Great variable names! And I really like that the channel is configurable via environment variables as well.

You might consider putting the `os.environ.get`s somewhere else. Right now, your code re-reads the env vars every time a task is completed. It might be better to read these variables just once when the app starts up, similar to what happens for the DB connection string in app/__init__.py

Nice post! An extension that we could do if this were a full production application would be to check the response code that we get back. If it's some error code, we could raise some exception for our application to handle.

Nice job asserting both the values of the response and what's stored in the database.

I'm fine with making this default. Decisions not options and if someone is using the API, it makes sense to me to cache it from the onset.


Just a styling note, but can we multiline this if?

```

    $wp_cache_request_uri == $wp_cache_home_path ||
    ( $something && something ) ||

```


Yeah, that's a good point to bring up. I don't have any ideas for how to map content to API endpoints right now (other than just a hardcoded list for known endpoints like `/posts`). 

One thing that could help avoid scaling issues, would be to keep track of when we flush the cache, and don't do it more often then once every 5 minutes, or something like that. We'll need to do more thinking/testing/etc there, though


Ah, that's a good idea. I initially rewrote that line into multiple variables so that the condition itself would read like:

`if ( $is_home_page || $request_meets_slashed_expectation || $request_meets_unslashed_expectation || $serve_supercache_file ) {`

...but then I worried about making too many changes to the core plugin, so I reverted it back. Changing them to be on separate lines is a great middle-ground, though.


Done in 09346d2


Note that `null`, `""hello""`, and `21345` are all completely valid JSON responses as well, but core wouldn't generate that by default.


You can check `rest_base` on the post types, but otherwise there's no generic mapping.


Thanks, I'll add a `@todo` note about that for future iterations.


What about JSONP responses? They won't match either pattern. Is it as simple as adding extra patterns?
```
$jsonp_object_pattern     = '^\/\*\*\/[_.a-zA-Z0-9]+\([{].*[}]\)$';
$jsonp_collection_pattern = '^\/\*\*\/[_.a-zA-Z0-9]+\([\[].*[\]]\)$';
...
sprintf( '<\?xml|%s|%s|%s|%s', $json_object_pattern, $json_collection_pattern, $jsonp_object_pattern, $jsonp_collection_pattern ),

Or is there more under the hood that needs changing? You mentioned in an earlier comment ""Ensuring the correct headers are sent, including for JSONP callbacks"" is still to do. Is that something else that would cause JSONP requests not to cache currently?

The point is that TokenRefreshSerializer.validate() (the new caller for this helper) doesn't currently hold a User object. Using just the id here avoids needing to query the database for one.

Another alternative that comes to mind would be just doing RefreshToken.for_user() at refresh instead of the current RefreshToken(attrs[""refresh""]) (create a new token from scratch instead of copying the claims from the previous one). That would require the query, though.

The suggested change of user_id to user_pk doesn't pass tests, and I can't find any hint that that syntax would be supported by the Django ORM.

However after looking at this a bit more, I don't think anything guarantees that api_settings.USER_ID_FIELD == User.id. So perhaps the query at TokenRefreshSerializer.validate() is unavoidable?

```suggestion
        ['index_1', 'index_2'],
```

Probably even nested arrays so that you can target different attribute names:

```js
[
  ['index_1', 'facets', 'exact_matches', 'data_origin1'],
  ['index_2', 'facets', 'exact_matches', 'data_origin2']
]
```

yes, looking at the example again, the whole item should be an array if we accept multiple indices

I thought a lot about how it could work, but I didn't came out with a case where we need to use different attribute names (maybe there is a case). `data_origin1 ` and `data_origin2 ` basically need to be a single attribute — `data_origin`, but this attribute would contain different values per index. So basically it almost the same as current `categoryAttribute`, but it searches multiple indexes, and picks only the first match from each. 

I need to wrap my head around a multi-attribute use-case, it wouldn't hurt probably, but currently I can't come up with an example usage for this — the current PR logic would accumulate and sort the multi-index matches like they're of a same ""kind"", but they can be completely different with multiple attributes 

I also described this in a ""Details"" section of PR description. Will providing different attribute names indeed make sense?

I see how in most/all use cases the facets would be completely identical, but I could imagine another index where the facet values are the same but translated, so they wouldn't be identical.

I prefer handling an optionally nested array over magic strings, as people could already be using | in their index names

Yeah, I also agree with arrays, just wasn't sure about multiple attributes, will redo it shortly

I did it, also outlined the docs in `categoryAttribute` description

can you explain why only one should be kept?

When indexes gets split by some uniform ""property"", like data origin, each index will contain same attribute (i.e. `data_origin`), and the value will be different for each index (`data_origin=""Store""` or `data_origin=""Blog""`), and same for all records across the index. By this logic, `attrVal ` should only contain 1 record, and if it's not the case — I thought it would ""wrong"" and took ""precautions""

But thinking about it now — the `categoryAttribute` logic/intention is to provide a facet used for accumulating available ""categories"" (facet values) which produce hits per each ""category"". This might mean there's no reason which will forbid to pass multiple non-related facets/attributes, for any indexes — plugin will just accumulate all the things, sorted by `count`. It is all available ""categories"" after all, so it shouldn't cause anything unusual

If the user wants to use the logic described in a 1st paragraph — they can use a uniform facet value across the index and get their single element inside `attrVal `. If something else is required — all the categories will be accumulated by provided paths

If this seems like a proper solution I'll keep all the elements (I'm not very familiar with all algolia peculiarities so can't judge, also this gets back to multi-attribute discussion — now it seems like it should be actually useful quite often). 

One thing is that if there're multiple indexes separated in described manner, and additionally some facet is used which can have different values across all indexes — how the actual searching will be done? This is multiple indexes needing to be filtered by facet and all hits accumulated in a single widget — but this is, as far as I understood, actually impossible to do I think? So could such attribute only be useful if applied for a single index? And could this be useful in a such ""multi-index"" scenario? It seems that for a single index it definitely could be useful

In short: I don't have enough algolia experience to decide on this

Ok, I think it will be best to keep all the items — it will be just a generic way of accumulating categories, and the user will decide what should be done with it

can we do this without this large extension of parameters? 
Wherever you're calling this it doesnt make too much sense as to what is happening

I have reopened this PR and made the changes that you have requested. A new class holding the parameters is now available. More refactoring can be done, like the _get_items_from_pages or the ResultList with useless parameters, but I have no clear view on hoe to proceed.

@adehad @studioj Could you please take a look if this new pager meets the expectations? If so, I'd need some help to define how to test this as it will require a connection to a Jira server (similar to the resources tests) but the current ResultList is handled in test_client.py

@turran when writing this implementation do you have any thoughts on what would make a better user experience?

I have been wondering if we can have a look at options for breaking changes in a major version bump, and am considering if we can perhaps use httpx and move to true async support. 

But perhaps that would be a separate package. We've inherited a lot of baggage so might also be worth considering what a clean slate might gain.

@adehad Good point. IMHO when building a library you need to define where you put the criteria of what the library can do for the user and what not. So far, the current Jira Python bindings aim to mimic as much as possible the REST API and doing synchronous calls for that, at the HTTP level. There are plenty of situations where the current 1:1 python - REST API can be abstracted to give a better user experience, but that's not the current situation.

Still, the Jira REST API itself can be batched and already has asynchronous operations internally, like the UPM interface where you get a task id and then the user queries an specific endpoint with that task id to know the status of it. This can be abstracted on the python library again as a 1:1 with sync calls or put some logic above to do the task handling automatically for you, but that would require async code for sure and httpx seems like a good option there.

Now, for APIs that support batches, like searching issues by JQL, yielding them is enough and won't require much heavy change on the current code. At the end, the REST API that work with batches behaves like a generator already :) 



I think I'll need to see the ergonomics of this through an example to really make a call on whether this should exist as code in the library or maybe in the documentation as an example of optimizing / improving performance.

So if you still have some capacity to write a test that would be ideal. I would perhaps make a new `tests/test_paginator.py` and use an endpoint you deem suitable for the example.

As you say the `tests/resources/` is probably a good place to see the new tests structure. I think the `search_issues()` would be a good one to make an example for as that is where I can imagine most people trying to leverage this. You can try searching Atlassian's own Jira https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa as they'll probably have much more tickets, and you won't need to authenticate to simply trawl through.


---- 

Thinking out loud

Maybe we can provide a `JiraAsync` class that uses a httpx session under the hood (vs a requests session) to start a process moving. A bit intimidating to look at all the functionality we support. But perhaps we can use the async class internally in the non-async class and simply have the non-async methods await the async methods. So users familiar with the sync calls could still benefit from async-ing the paginated endpoints for example.



----

Thanks again for taking the time for the PR and suggestions, hope we can figure out something that would work, and sorry that I'm a bit overly cautious for some changes !

O good point

I mentioned this in another review, but consider renaming `GENRE_ANALYSIS` to `GENRE_ANALYSIS_TASK` or `GENRE_ANALYSIS_PROMISE` so that it is extra clear that this object is a `Promise`.

My opinion here would be to pass the entire map rather than separating it out. In createBarChart, we start to lose the connection between these two arrays when you're accessing values in one array based on the length of the other array. Open to other thoughts though @geekster777?

You shouldn't export a call to a promise. This line will trigger this fetch /anytime/ this file is imported. This may be what you want in the short term, but isn't what folks will expect from a library/file they import. You should instead export `fetchMusicGenre`, and call it in your other file.

You shouldn't pass this value in. Instead compute it from `chartValues`.

+1. It makes your function call more concise, and like Jess said, keeps the direct connection between your categories and their values.

As stated below, just import fetchMusicGenre and call it here.

In general, libraries and imported files shouldn't have side effects. They should be idempotent.

It looks like the indentation is off a bit in a few places around this line.

The coding standards call for tabs instead of spaces.

We've got a custom `phpcs.xml.dist` file in Meta repo that describes the standards for WordCamp.org. Using `phpcs` makes it really easy to find any violations before committing. There's also a `.githooks/pre-commit` script in the Meta repo that you can use to automatically do PHP syntax checks, run `phpcs`, and run `phpmd` before committing. 

I'd recommend setting those up, even if you only run them manually. It's a lot easier than memorizing everything at first, and more consistent.

What do you think about using `npm` / `package.json` to register this as a dependency and include it, instead of manually bundling it?

That'd make it easier to get security notifications via `npm audit` and GitHub.

We'd still need to explicitly bundle it in the SVN repo, but that's no problem.

Kudos for doing coding standards fixes, and for doing them in a separate commit :)

The `Development Practices` doc has some helpful points on writing commit messages. 

> Use the imperative mood when possible: “Relax term ID comparisons…” instead of “Relaxes term ID comparisons…” [ from Core handbook ]

Something like `Replace spaces with tabs.`, or just a generic `Apply coding standards.` would fit a little bit better. 

This is one of the places we'd like to add it. It'd also be use it for the `currency` dropdown and the Summarize fields in wp-admin.

It's probably best to avoid updating the commit messages, rebasing, and force-pushing until we've finished reviewing everything else, though, since the force-push will wipe out a lot of the GitHub comments.

I want a configuration because of accessibility (https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/3744) . Looks like this is also the blocker for merging select2 in core. What do you think ? At the very least, we should enable by default. 

That's a good point. They could always call `wp_dequeue_script()` from a plugin to disable it, but I realize that'd require some development experience.

It sounds like one our coworkers has already [forked Select2 to make it accessible](https://github.com/woocommerce/selectwoo), so maybe we should switch to that instead?

If you feel like it, it might even be good to send a PR to selectWoo to merge in the upstream changes. That'd help us by fixing any bugs that haven't made it downstream; help selectWoo users for the same reason; and eventually help WP Core and Drupal, by making it easy to merge the a11y fixes upstream.

In general we try to be good open source citizens, but of course it always has to be balanced against time spent on our own priorities. This seems like a really good opportunity, though. 

Or, rather than trying to merge downstream, maybe it'd be better to just cherry-pick commits from downstream and send PRs upstream? That may be more efficient, since any changes will need to be tested in either direction. Whichever you think is best :)

I have send in some PRs in wooSelect (https://github.com/woocommerce/selectWoo/pull/18 and https://github.com/woocommerce/selectWoo/pull/17) but it will take a while before they get merged. I want to wait till they get before we use wooSelect, since it doesn't have downstream changes, but we can use it right away as well. What do you think ?

Agree that we should use npm. Lets wait for wooSelect, we can this push this as a separate change. 

There is a separate patch for currency, since its not a part of camptix. Or am I confusing with a different currency dropdown ?

Yeah. CampTix has a currency dropdown on the `Tickets > Setup > General` screen. The Summarize one is under `Tickets > Tools`.

It sounds like they'll be looking at it soon, so waiting is probably fine in this case. If it takes them longer than expected, then we can always go ahead and use the setup the latest `master` build now, and then update it after your PRs are merged.

Ah ok. Added.

The version numbers used to register the stylesheet and script should be the version of Select2, not CampTix.

Just noting here at that since the Select2 assets will always be both registered and enqueued if the option is enabled, you can save a step by just calling the `enqueue` functions with all the same parameters, and they will take care of the registration as well.

But I guess another question is, should the assets _always_ be enqueued, or only for certain views?

Our tests don't confirm this, but should tasks be able to store `NULL` titles and descriptions? 

All columns are nullable by default, so we can remove the `nullable = True` attribute from the `completed_at` column and it will work the same way. 

You're not using `make_response` anywhere else in this file so we can omit this import.

Nice! Great use the not operator to determine the value of `is_complete`.

When a Flask app returns a dictionary, it automatically converts that dictionary into JSON. So there's no need to use `jsonify()` for dictionaries. We should use `jsonify()` for all other datatypes though!

We can refactor this function by moving the dictionary logic into a helper function for the `Task` model. 

```suggestion
    response_body = {
        ""task"": task.to_dict()
        }
```

We'll need to return task instances as dictionaries in our routes, so adding a helper method to do so will help us get rid of a lot of repetitive dictionary logic.

```
def to_dict(self):
    task = {
        ""id"": new_task.task_id,
        ""title"": new_task.title,
        ""description"": new_task.description,
        ""is_complete"": new_task.completed_at is not None
    }
    return task
```

This would be a good spot to use list comprehension and the helper method for the task dictionary.

```suggestion
    task_responses = [task.to_dict() for task in tasks]
```

Notice how these conditionals return a dictionary with the same key value pairs (besides goal_id) ? Instead of explicitly writing out this same dictionary twice, we can write a ""base"" dictionary and add the goal_id to it if it exists for the task.

```suggestion
    task_dict = {
            ""id"": task.task_id,
            ""title"": task.title,
            ""description"": task.description,
            ""is_complete"": False if task.completed_at == None else True
        }

    if task.goal_id:
        task_dict[""goal_id] = task.goal_id   
    return task_dict, 200
```

We can also have this same logic within a Task class helper method as well!

This logic doesn't need to be wrapped in an else clause. You can omit the else clause, unindent this code, and see that it works the same way.



This also doesn't need to be wrapped in an else clause

No need to create an empty dictionary first before adding keys and values to it.

Nice helper function!

```suggestion

```

👍 

👍 

```suggestion

```

Great work on the task routes! We can make `routes.py` much shorter if we separate the task and goal routes into separate files

👍 

👍 

This logic doesn't need to be in the `else` logic. And it would also be helpful for the `Goal` model to have a dictionary helper method.

👍  Same comments in `GET` request apply here too.

👍 

👍  Good work! This part was tricky!

Great work practicing the single responsibility principle for the goal routes!

👍 

👍 

👍 

This last assert statement doesn't scale well. We can't assume that deleting a goal would always produce an empty goal table. Rather, we can do a query to retrieve a goal at id `1` and confirm that `None` is returned. 

```suggestion
    assert Goal.query.get(1) == None
```

I don't like to code that. I prefer to implement a new configuration on the backend side that defines whether the `Survey Feedback` feature is enabled or not.

Hi @renatobecker,
I like this idea. This would be like the `Transcript Chats` feature which Livechat already has. I think the admin should have a setting at the main server, to On/Off the Feedback section. This would be more powerful.

Yeah, that's the idea, we gonna provide a setting to enable/disable the survey feedback.

Hello, 
Added a PR in the main server which will add a setting to show/hide a Feedback form. Also updated the code here to connect with the backend setting.
Link to PR - https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17912

Hello! I checked this PR and found an error that the comment message is not sent to the server. It depends on the server config for livechat. 

Hello @antkaz, U r correct. This PR doesn't send the comment message to the server. I tried sending it, but the server is not configured to handle it hence it was throwing an error. So in order to send the comment message, some of the interfaces and checks on the server will need to be modified.

I can help you do it

It would be awesome! 

I created new PR for ROcket.Chat https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/18280 where I fixed old survey config and added feedback form config.

With that being said, we probably shouldn't replace the default queue that is being used, since the original use case is supposed to be for the concurrent environments. I suggest adding the ability for the user to configure which type of queue they want by adding an option [here](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-python/blob/master/contrib/opencensus-ext-azure/opencensus/ext/azure/common/__init__.py#L119). Then you can create a different type queue accordingly.

Why does object need to be serializable?

Please add an entry to the CHANGELOG

This doesn't work because `apply_telemetry_processors` is expecting an `Envelope` data type.

I think there are performance implications of doing this. We don't want to be mapping every time `logger.X()` is called.

In order to share messages/resources between different processes, the multiprocessing.Queue pickles the object so that it can be piped: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.10/Lib/multiprocessing/queues.py#L244

It does work; the batch is a list of `Envelope` data type objects as I converted them already before putting them on the queue.

There is indeed a performance loss here. However it is not possible to put a raw `LogRecord` on the multiprocessing.Queue as it pickles the object.

It does work with threading, however in an environment where multiple processes are being used (see linked bug reports), the queue is not being shared between the different processes. Therefore a multiprocessing.Queue is required to get this to work.

`The pricing module that should be used for pricing products.`.

Also, you probably must reindex all product prices after we change this setting. Add a warning on the help text saying all prices will be reindexed once the pricing module changes:

Create a util inside shuup/core/catalog/utils.py called `reindex_all_shop_products` with the content:

Then call this util when either pricing_module changes or discount modules change.

Also call this method inside `shuup/core/management/commands/reindex_product_catalog.py` (remove the current logic from there and just call that function.

the choices here come from provides as well: `order_source_modifier_module`

use **_supplier_** wording here instead of **_vendor_** here, Shuup OS is ignostic of multivendor addon, it means VENDOR only exist in our private addons. Shuup OS is a single shop model, not multivendor. 

I think you should clear the configuration cache one you save this form. Maybe you can even create a sigal in `shuup/admin/signals.py` called `settings_updated` and trigger that after `save_form_parts` is called  in case some addon wants to double check things after something has changed:

```py
@atomic
    def form_valid(self, form):
        response = self.save_form_parts(form)
        settings_updated.send(sender=type(self), shop=get_shop(self.request))
        return response
```

it is not a good idea to touch on this function. I recall we are using this in several places in addons and projects. I would rather create a new  function to load from a configuration or create a new parameter to control this.

`shuup/apps` shouldn't know anything abount `shuup/core` or shuup/admin`. Can you create some provide key to load them dynamically?

fallback to a blank list just in case:

```py
bool(""catalog_campaigns"" in (configuration.get(None, SHUUP_DISCOUNT_MODULES) or []))
```

you can't import shuup.from in shuup.core. they are different apps that shouldn't depent on each other.
front can depend on core but not the inverse. the more independent they are the better.

same here, create one migration for each app

add translated label for both forms

for every setting, use a getattr and fallback to the value that was in settings.py:

```py
configuration.set(None, SHUUP_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_ORDERS, getattr(settings, ""SHUUP_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_ORDERS"", True))
```

We need to do this because we need to delete the entries from the settings.py, we shouldn't keep those anymore.

When I started the task a decade ago it wasn't still merged. But now I can. :)

ups, I'll leave evidence behind

ObjectSelect2ModelField requires a model, ObjectSelect2MultipleField doesn't but we want to select just one country. So I think LazyTypedChoiceField does a good job here.

In every case, the initial value is taken from configuration, so there is no need. We just need to initialize correctly the configuration values.

Much better

Ok, I'm going to separate them, but I think is safer the way I implemented, as load_module looks first in the configuration and it falls back to settings. Any add-on using load_module will still work. If there is an add-on relying on the settings that we moved, will no longer work. So I must identify all the cases.

We need to specify in each form which fields are encrypted.

I took the setting values from shuup.core.settings.

move this file to `shuup/core/settings_keys.py`. You will need to split the keys into different apps: core, front, xtheme, etc.

what is this `#:`, copied from settings? :D 

this choices must be loaded dynamically. Use the `shuup/core/pricing/_discounts.py::get_discount_modules()` to get them:

```py
choices = [(module.identifier, module.name) for module in get_discount_modules()]
```

`The mist of discount modules to use in the platform.`

same as discount modules, but we don't have a method to return an iterator of modules, we need to iterate over provides directly:
```py
choices = [(module.identifier, module.name) for module in get_provides_objects(""pricing_module"")]
```

`The pricing module that should be used for pricing products.`.

Also, you probably must reindex all product prices after we change this setting. Add a warning on the help text saying all prices will be reindexed once the pricing module changes:

Create a util inside shuup/core/catalog/utils.py called `reindex_all_shop_products` with the content:

```py
def reindex_all_shop_products():
    for shop_product in ShopProduct.objects.exclude(product__mode=ProductMode.VARIATION_CHILD):
            ProductCatalog.index_shop_product(shop_product)
```
Then call this util when either pricing_module changes or discount modules change.

Also call this method inside `shuup/core/management/commands/reindex_product_catalog.py` (remove the current logic from there and just call that function.

the choices here come from provides as well: `order_source_modifier_module`

```py
choices = [(module.identifier, module.name) for module in get_provides_objects(""order_source_modifier_module"")]

```

don't we have a default for this?

can we use a ObjectSelector here? 😄  

this comes from provides: `tax_module`

`The tax module used to determining taxes of products and order lines.`

`Whether taxes should be calculated automatically.`

add a default value here: `pdf`, `png`, `jpeg`, `jpg`

add a default value here

you need to translate the options and kg must be lowercase:
```py
choices=(
   (""kg"", _(""Kilogram"")),
   (""g"", _(""Gram"")),
   (""lb"", _(""Pound"")),
)
```

translate these as well

translate

create a list of keys and do the same check for all of them:

```py
boolean_fields = [""enable_attributes"", ""enable_multiple_shops"", ...]
for field in boolean_fields:
  if field not in self.data:
    self.fields[field].value = False
```

`Whether to allow the use of rich text editor and HTML for product description.`

`""Whether to allow the use of rick text editor and HTML for their profile descriptions. ""`

👍 

One thing we can do to help our routes file from getting too large is to consider making multiple files containing routes separated by the resource type. We might have a `routes` folder instead of a `routes.py` file, and inside that folder (along with a `__init__.py`) we could have a file per resource, so `task.py` and `goal.py`. Where each would have a blueprint and endpoints for that resource. When we have one blueprint per file, we often name the blueprint simply `bp` rather  than including the resource name as part of it.

Then here, we could import and register the blueprints like
```python
    from .routes import task, goal
    app.register_blueprint(task.bp)
    app.register_blueprint(goal.bp)
```


According to the SqlAlchemy docs about [autoincrement](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/metadata.html#sqlalchemy.schema.Column.params.autoincrement):

> The default value is the string ""auto"" which indicates that a single-column primary key that is of an INTEGER type with no stated client-side or python-side defaults should receive auto increment semantics automatically; all other varieties of primary key columns will not.

This means that here, since the primary is not a compound key, the type is integer, and there's no specified default value, the desired autoincrement behavior will apply even without listing it. It doesn't hurt anything to list it, but it's not required.


Should we be able to create a goal with a NULL title? Consider adding `nullable=False` here.


👍 

Nice job having two different methods to provide the two different needed output styles. We could have used the `goal_dict` version to get the base values, then add in `tasks`, but given the size this seems ok.

Notice that as applications grow, we may end up with a large variety of endpoints that may need slightly different outputs. In that situation, rather than adding method after method to model class itself, we often will make helper _classes_ whose sole responsibility is knowing how to render a model instance into a certain output configuration. Sometimes we call these helper classes data transfer objects (DTOs).

It turns out that `nullable=True` is the default value for nullable. So all of the columns for Task here are currently marked as nullable. But should title or description be allowed to be NULL? (Does that make sense from a data standpoint?) Consider adding `nullable=False` to those columns.

The way the project emphasized that completed_at needs to accept NULL values may make it seem like we needed to explicitly call out that nullable should be True, but it turns out this is the default for nullable. Instead, we should think about the other data in our model and consider whether it makes sense for any of it to be NULL. If not, we can have the database help us protect against that happening!


Again, having these two methods is fine and clearly indicates to a caller that they might produce different output. But another approach would be to have a single dictionary function, and only add the `goal_id` field to the output if the task is associated with a goal. This means that the output format for the task could change depending on its data relationships, which could be confusing, but it also means that the task itself is the one deciding whether to include that information, which the argument could be made that the task is the best one to make that decision, rather than logic in a route. This would also allow this behavior to occur anywhere we return a task, whether individually or in a list.

Notice that, as written, getting multiple tasks would omit any goal information since the route wasn't updated to be aware of goals.

Unnecessary input, likely from a spurious autocomplete

No need to import the dotenv stuff anywhere but in the main `__init__.py` file. Once the settings have been loaded at startup, they become available in the `os.environ` without any further action.

Notice that the logic for GET and POST doesn't share any code, so if we wanted to try refactoring this we could consider putting the logic for each in separate functions, maybe `get_tasks` and `create_task`.

👍 

Good job enforcing the POST data requirements. We should be doing similar checks when PUTting a task as well. So we could also think about moving checks like this into validation helpers so that they are easier to reuse elsewhere.

We could even think about adding a class method to `Task` to create a new `Task` using the dictionary from a request body

```python
    @classmethod
    def from_dict(values):
        # create a new task, and set the model values from the values passed in
        # be sure to validate that all required values are present, we could return `None` or raise an error if needed
        return new_task
```


Also, nice use of `()` in the `if` to enable implicit line wrapping. This is prefered over using explicit line wrapping (`\` at the end of a line).

This can also be written as
```python
        tasks = Task.query.order_by(Task.title.asc())
```
which lets us avoid importing the `asc` function. We can do the same thing for `desc` and then that extra import could be removed.

Notice also that using the static column field `Task.title` has a greater opportunity for the IDE to correctly autocomplete, whereas using `""title""` could introduce typos.


👍 

Nice list comprehension!

Each of these verbs does depend on retrieving an existing task from the database by id, so there's a stronger case for keeping these together. But we could still think about splitting these into separate functions (e.g. `get_task`, `update_task`, and `delete_task`). We would need to either duplicate the lookup code in each function, or create a helper function that can be shared among the separated functions.


As alluded to earlier, should the route be the one that decides which model rendering function to use by inspecting the goal relationship within the task itself? Or should the task simply be asked to convert itself to a dictionary, and then it decides how to build the dictionary given its own internal state? It's not clear either way, but it's definitely worth thinking about!

We should be sure that the same fields required for POSTing are included here for PUT. PUT _replaces_ the value for the supplied task id, so we should ensure that all of the values required to represent a `Task` are provided with the same restrictions as we had when creating it in the first place.

At the least, we should ensure that the keys are present in the dictionary before trying to access them, otherwise this request would cause a `KeyError`.


Notice that this chunk of looking up an id, checking for None, and returning a 404 when not found recurs frequently. It's a little tricky to extract this into a helper function, mostly since a helper function can't force the calling function to exit. That is, unless it raises an error. So we could think about writing a helper function to perform this set of steps, but we would also need to customize the Flask error handling behavior to return JSON rather than HTML. There _is_ the `get_or_404` method that essentially does the lookup with errors already, but we would should still update the flask error handling (see [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/errorhandling/#error-handlers) for more details.)

Another approach could be to use a decorator to intercept the task id from the route, and performt the lookup before reaching the body of our endpoint. There's an example of that [here](https://github.com/AdaGold/hello-books-api-decorated/blob/main/app/routes.py).


Consider using `utcnow()` rather than `now()`, especially if there's no timezone information on the datetime in the database. When working with dates and time, it's usually a good idea to pass them around and store them in UTC, and only convert them to local time when needed for display (like in a UI). Working with dates and times is tricky!


👍 

Nice POST request to Slack!

Consider putting this part of the code into _its own_  helper function. All the mark complete endpoint really needs to know how to do is call a method that can post to Slack with the message to post. The rest of the details could be hidden in the helper, and potentially called from multiple places!


Similar feedback about splitting these functions, and moving validation and dictionary-handling logic around that I made for `Task` will also apply to `Goal`. These are common themes for any model with CRUD operations.


Good job checking whether the each requested task id lookup is successful before trying to append it to the task list. However, you may want to wait to perform the appending and commiting until after you have validated _all_ the tasks, rather than task by task. With the task-by-task approach, we could end up partially modifying the tasks in a goal, but then fail partway through the list, leaving the goal partially modified. It's often desirable to ensure that either the entire change has been applied, or none of the change has.

Appending to the tasks realtionship is absolutely a valid way to associate a task with a goal. Notice that it's not entirely clear from the project description or tests whether POSTing to the task list is _adding_ tasks to the goal (in addition to anything that was already there), or _replacing_ the tasks in the goal. Which perspective does your implementation take? How could we implement the other approach?


Don't forget to add a message to your migrations with `-m` when running the migration step.


We should remove the `pass` statement after supplying the test body.


An alternative to directly accessing the DB here would be to make an additional GET request. Doing so keeps us at the same level of abstraction (exercising the web API) while still checking that a change has been made (deletion of the goal) without assuming how the deletion is occuring (maybe we want to use a deleted flag rather than actually deleting the row).

This is prone to return a page of type text/html with the text `shall_signin` after the first attempt, but perhaps not with a login cookie. 
```suggestion
        video_webpage = self._download_webpage(get_url, video_id)
        if 'shall_signin' in video_webpage[:20]:
            raise ExtractorError(
                ""Login required: use --cookies to pass your browser's login cookie, or try again later"",
                expected=True)
```
`later` could be made more explicit if we knew a more accurate value.

The page (when I could get to it) looks like standard HTML5 video. Try this instead:
```suggestion
        entries = self._parse_html5_media_entries(get_url, video_webpage)
        if not entries:
           raise ExtractorError('No media links found')
        return merge_dicts({
            'id': video_id,
            'title': title,
            'description': self._og_search_description(webpage),
        }, entries[0])
```

As far as I'm aware I cannot find a free to play video, it seems that there is a free version indeed, but I don't know what is the logic behind that.

I can change the wording no problem.

```suggestion
            self.raise_login_required()
```

```suggestion

    @staticmethod
    def raise_login_required(msg='Login required: use --cookies to pass your browser's login cookie, or try again later'):

1. Just return the response from the CS-API.
2. Return whatever the client is doing to provide the user list in their invite dialogs (and injecting them transparently into the results list without the widget noticing).

For 2., Element does many additional things that is currently implemented in the [`InviteDialog`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/blob/e5291c195d3259b5905d72dc2945ed740fffc6d1/src/components/views/dialogs/InviteDialog.tsx). If we would want to provide the client-enhanced list instead of the raw server response, this would require refactoring in the react-sdk. But for the long term (if [MSC3008](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3008) becomes a reality) it might be questionable how useful that would be. It could for example be an option to move the code to the js-sdk and expecting that future widgets will keep using that one. If the MSC is formulated openly enough, it could also leave other client authors the option to not do any additional processing here.

I agree with the thought, that the widget api should not be unnecassarly complex to implement for other clients. I think the better solution for a better user list would be to use the js-sdk for the widget and run the user list modifications to be done inside the widget.

I am wondering if using ""we"" is common in MSC's. I have not seen it before. I am not aware if there are any rules. But I think rephrasing without ""we"" would not hurt?

(this is very nitpicky indeed...)

Good point. I'm used to write ADRs for our own products which are written from our teams perspective. I will rewrite it later to better fit the MSC styling

This looks like it was copied from MSC2762 but doesn't quite fit here. Maybe the sentence ""The widget is responsible..."" should be removed completely?

Is this needed? Doesn't the following bullet point cover everything? (Or is this a standard sentence we include in this section?)

Not necessarily. So far, actions in the Widget API (like `read_event`, `send_event`, ...) are not prefixed with `m.*`, so the second point would not apply here. The first point mainly references the new permission `m.user_directory_search` while the second references the action `user_directory_search`.

This is is a copy from MSC2762 because it asks for the same behavior. MSC2762 is mainly defining the actions `read_event` and `send_event` but I would de-facto see it as a more general that kind-of defines the general behavior of the contract between the homeserver, the client, and the widget. But I'm fine with skipping it in this proposal.

            r'https://video\.nest\.com/clip/(.+?)(?:\.|"")', webpage, 'video_id', fatal=False) or video_id

Actually, is this ever different from the value extracted from the page URL? With the correct `_VALID_URL`, you should have a good value for it. If you do need to do this search, use the `_VALID_URL` again:
```suggestion
        video_id = self._search_regex(
            self._VALID_URL, webpage, 'video_id', group='id', fatal=False) or video_id

As a result, it has been suggested that an `origin` field be added to the top level of PDUs. Granted this is provided from the transactions endpoint, but while backfilling servers currently have to infer the origin from the `sender`.

I believe that it is possible to proxy this room version to clients without changing the client server api depending on how you implement users/members in a dependent MSC, even if sender is removed from the top level of PDUs. Still stands that it probably isn't desirable to emulate the existing behavior and it would just complicate things.

Use the library functions to parse a URL; also `bitrate` is going to be `abr` which is not a required field:

This section of code shows up in several other routes and is a great candidate for a helper function.  Returning a response from a helper function adds a little complexity, but using the Flask `abort` function could help there:
```
def get_task_fom_id(id):
    task = Task.query.get(id)
    if not task:
        abort(404)
    return task
```
The abort function will generate an HTML response by default, but passing `make_response` to abort makes it possible to send any type of response (ie, `abort(make_response("""", 404))`).

Very thorough validation!  Nice work!

Great helper!

👍 

👍 

Interesting!  This query brings up some neat questions (what if there were other tasks in the db with a matching goal_id, or what if some of the task ids that were passed in aren't valid). 

This works well, but the db.relationship `tasks` in the Goal model does the query for you (note, I think as written now the db.relationship works this way, but please see my note in goal.py as there's a piece missing and I'm not sure how that effects it). In Goal, tasks will be set up as a list of Task models with the matching goal_id.
```suggestion
    goal = Goal.query.get(goal_id)
    if not goal:
        return """", 404
    tasks = [task.to_dict() for task in goal.tasks]
```

This db.relationship should generate a list of tasks (Task models) but it may need `back_populates` added:
```suggestion
    tasks = db.relationship('Task', back_populates=""goal"", lazy=True)
```
When using `back_populates` I think it's needed in the db.relationship on both ends (one & many).  However, using `backref` simplifies this:
```suggestion
    tasks = db.relationship('Task', backref=""goal"", lazy=True)
```
When using `backref`, the relationship on the other side is generated automatically, so line 12 of task.py can be removed.  Each Goal will have a `tasks` var that is a list of Task models, and each Task model will have a var `goal` that is the `Goal` model with the correct goal_id.

Please look for a way to get a specific DNN module setting by name, including a default value/type.  I believe it's in the base class for the module, named `GetModuleSetting` and `GetTabModuleSetting`, respectively.  It might also be coming from the `ModuleController` class.  

@VAlmea Since these are settings, they don't represent content.  Therefore, shouldn't we be checking that this API call is valid and/or with the appropriate permissions?

The main page is the only SPA. The settings view is the same one used for all other modules. The reference to Knockout was already implemented. I'll check 

@VAlmea Any response?

Fixed

Yes. Before sending the request we call the `service.framework.setModuleHeaders` method. And the controller actions have the `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` action filter

Why instantiate the ModuleController class when we have access to the same property inherited from DnnApiController? For this specific case, I only validate that the necessary parameters exist to build the response DTO

We have the security filters defined at the top of the controller class as global. I don't quite understand what you mean. Should we add extra security?

@WillStrohl I Tested the configuration view and it is not necessary to reference the Knockout library. I have removed it

Modifier le commentaire pour expliquer ce que fait cette migration; à la manière de  https://github.com/n7consulting/Incipio/blob/master/src/Migrations/Version20190105082511.php#L11

Je vois plusieurs problèmes avec cette requête:

1. Naming: habituellement les fonctions findAllByX prennent X en argument. En regardant l'implémentation, cette requête devrait plutot s’appeler findAll
2. Problème de performance à venir avec cette fonction. Il faut utiliser une requête SQL au lieu de cette boucle (qui posera des problèmes dès que le nombre de contact se mettra à croître).
3. Problème de structure (ce qui explique 2). Cette fonction récupère tous les contacts puis les retourne groupés par alumnus. Tu peux obtenir exactement la même chose en faisant un select sur les alumnus qui ont plus d'un contact + un join sur ces contacts. Le résultat retourné sera exactement le même que cette requete mais évitera le point 2.



Même remarques que pour `findAllByAlumnus`

Le manager registry doit être récupéré depuis la classe, pas passé en paramètre.

Exemple: https://github.com/n7consulting/Incipio/blob/master/src/Repository/Personne/MembreRepository.php#L31

Doit être fait via une requete SQL et non une boucle.

Cette migration modifie des tables qui n'existent pas encore. Elle doit être supprimée pour ne pas créer d'erreurs comme https://github.com/n7consulting/Incipio/runs/4058979326?check_suite_focus=true#step:7:306


Corrigé via edit perso de la PR.

Toutes les informations alumnis ne sont pas affichées lorsque l'on est sur la fiche d'un membre (URL: membres/voir/1).

Ca réduit l'utilisabilité s'il faut aller éditer à chaque fois que l'on souhaite consulter les informations alumnis.

De même, il faudrait afficher les contacts alumnis (n'afficher le cadre alumni que s'il y a des contacts ou des infos almunis) sur la fiche d'un membre.

Erreur de copié-collé ?

Mauvaise layout. Celle-ci est celle du suivi de projet

Mauvaise layout. Celle-ci est celle du suivi de projet.

Il faut rajouter les infos alumnis & alumnis contact à la partie RGPD.

Plus de détails sur l'implémentation disponible ici: https://github.com/n7consulting/Incipio/pull/238/files

En plus de modifier les templates pour inclure l'affichage des informations personnelles des alumnis,

Il faut annoter les champs contenant des infos personnelles avec l'annotation `@Groups({""gdpr""})` pour qu'ils soient inclus dans l'export.

L'ajout d'un bouton comme sur le pipeline de suivi d'étude n'est pas nécessaire (aucun action contextuelle supplémentaire) et rend l'affichage moins lisible (car moins de lignes par écran).

Je partirais plutôt sur un simple lien vers la fiche de membre.

pas de maxsize définie. Saisir un texte trop long génère une erreur 500.

```

```



255 pour un titre est assez long.
128 devrait suffire.

Le champ est marqué nullable alors qu'il est required dans le formulaire. Autant ne pas le marquer comme nullable

Contenu est trop court. 255 caractères me semble très limité

Pareil qu'objet. Le champ n'a pas besoin d'etre nullable s'il est required dans le formulaire.

/!\ Attention aux migrations en cas d'édition

Pas besoin d'etre nullable.
Pas besoin d'etre si long quand les options proposées sont 'mail', 'telephone', 'physique', 'lettre'.

Au passage sur les moyens de contacts, vous pourriez peut être ajouté 'réseaux sociaux' pour couvrir les contacts via Linkedin

Cette classe n'est pas importée.

Concernant les FormHandler, faire une classe à part entière pour finalement si peu de validation et ne l'utiliser qu'à un endroit est discutable. (le ratio complexité / bénéfices me semble limité).

Le code commenté doit être supprimé

Ca serait pratique d'avoir un lien vers la liste des contacts dans le breadcrumb

Ne pas afficher le lien si le champ est vide:

```suggestion
{% if alumnus.alumnus.lienLinkedIn %}
 <a href =""{{ alumnus.alumnus.lienLinkedIn }}"">{{  'rh.voir_profil'|trans({}, 'rh') }} </a>
{% endif %}
```

C'est un détail, mais sémantiquement plus correct.

Il y a un bug dans la gestion des alumnis. Voici comment le reproduire.

 1. Ouvrir le profil d'un membre sans profil alumni.
 2. Modifier l'email
 3. Enregistrer

=> Le membre apparaît dans la liste des alumnis alors qu'aucune information alumni n'est renseignée.
A priori, un membre ne devrait apparaitre dans la liste des alumnis que si des informations alumnis sont renseignées.

Une meilleur option serait de ne pas créer l'entité alumni si tous les champs sont nuls.
Et de garder l'ancienne requete.

Commentaire ne doit pas  être annoté `gdpr`. Sinon il se retrouvera dans l'export d'une personne.

Et d'expérience, le contenu des commentaires est parfois très honnête; pas quelque chose que l'on veut partager. Enfin commentaire ne contient pas d'infos appartenant à la personne. Donc l’anonymiser est parfait. mais l'exporter ne l'est pas.

Pourquoi est ce que certains sont mis à null et d'autres à `' '` ?

suggestion: renommer ce champ `membre` pour ne pas introduire de confusion

Ce champ doit être annoté `@Groups({""gdpr""})` pour que l'export soit également appliqué sur `Alumnus`

See 74eafd543bc9efe4e33290c7837c62a2c55844ed

See 74eafd543bc9efe4e33290c7837c62a2c55844ed
Also change `access.html.twig` template
The `if` condition is a bit cumbersome but still maintainable with only 3 attributes.
Is it normal that on the `access.html.twig` template I can access non-gdpr attributes from `alumnus` class ?

```suggestion
            return any('learning.oreilly.com/%s/' % x in urlh.geturl() for x in ('member/login', 'home'))
```

Depending on how oreilly is accessed, the URL can end up being ""https://learning.oreilly.com/member/login/?next=[snip]"" for cases where the user is not yet logged in.  So we don't want to catch that case here with the `in` instead of `==`.

Given that, is there a more conventional way to format the check being done here?



Maybe 
```sugg
            return bool(re.search(r'learning.oreilly.com/(?:%s)' % '|'.join(('member/login/$', 'home/')), urlh.geturl()))
```
or 
```sugg
            parsed_url = compat_urlparse.urlparse(url)
            return parsed_url.hostname.endswith('learning.oreilly.com') and (
                parsed_url.path.startswith('/home/')
                or (parsed_url.path == '/member/login' and not parsed_url.query))
```
Pick either of these or your original, check your test, and then I think it's good to go.

Committed your second suggestion.

Here are two logs showing successful downloads.  The first is for a course with multiple videos.  This is the case that was broken before this pull request.  The second is for a specific video to ensure that still works.

The MoE seeks out opportunities for contributors to move up the scale if they are happy to do so, and the community manager will ensure this happens and opportunities are available. 
```

```suggestion
When new members show interest in being a part of the project, they will be onboarded and briefed on the project's aims and objectives as well as progress updates.

```suggestion
This will be in the form of an onboarding pack which includes all materials that are needed to succesfully understand the project, as well as a 1:1 chat with the Community Manager who will ensure all information is understood. 
```

Is the 1:1 chat something we can offer as the project grows? If you have capacity to do this, that's great! The strategy can also be changed if needed.

Fab!

Also, instead or relying on `DOMSubtreeModified` event, you probably just need to setup a time interval `setInterval()` to update the preview each 2-3 seconds when the preview is visible and remove it when the preview is closed.

Example: https://codemirror.net/demo/preview.html

I am not sure ALL actions will have this preview feature, basically just `SendEmail`. Add an attribute called `supports_preview = False` in base `Action` class (shuup/notify/base.py) and set it to True in `SendMail` action.

@kapilt  Thx for the feedback. 
For org, this filter is similar to gcp filter filter-scc-findings(which also takes org as an input).
There is no environment variable org id that's available in stacklet/c7n for gcp, so we will have to derive it for the project this filter runs on.
So, it feels its more flexible to inject it.

But I can change to derive the executing org, if that seems more appropriate.
OR
I can also make it optional, so if the user inputs org, get it from there, otherwise derive the current org of executing user and use that.

Please let me know.

Thx, made the filter name ""essential-contacts"" now.

@kapilt Can you please take a look at the comment above and provide feedback.
Thx

@kapilt I changed code to now make org optional. If it's not part of input, its derived from the executing gcp project. Please review.
Thx


curious as I saw this in the access filter as well, but why is this called get_findings in both?

resource specific filters should go in the python module that defines the resource, the filters package is for filters that apply across resource types.

Un parser può semplicemente ricostruire tutto il gioco leggendo lo yaml e ricavare l'informazione completa e aggiornata.

`x-ecosystem` è sotto  `x-catalog` ?

In questo caso (Muoversi Lombardia) potete valorizzare i campi? @stefkohub 

Qui ci mettiamo un bel provvisiorio `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`

Possiamo prendere i valori dal file di specifica E015? Chi lo gestisce? Possiamo coinvolgerli in modo da ottenere un template che loro possono riusare.

Questo se definito fa' override del default definito per l'API, corretto? Per i campi scaduti useremo `deprecated` https://swagger.io/specification/#operationObject.



Mi piace l'idea del path relativo perché diminuisce potenziali errori. D'altro canto però un URL assoluto permette scenari dove un'informazione di healthcheck viene fornita da un aggregatore che smista stati ed aggiornamenti. Lascerei quindi la scelta di usare un path assoluto o relativo.
Su timeout sono totalmente d'accordo, sul method non sono sicuro. 
Dare la possibilità di fare test diversi da GET significa dover definire una modalità di rappresentazione della richiesta e della risposta, ed anche la modalità di comparazione del risultato atteso con quello dato. Forse diventa troppo complicato. 

Questo avrebbe senso gestirlo con la granularità negli schemas, in modo da poter taggare i singoli campi e appoggiarsi ad eventuali schemi metadatabili (Eg. vedi il riferimento che questo schema ha verso le ontologie https://github.com/teamdigitale/openapi/blob/master/docs/schemas/tax_code.yaml)

In questo caso si potrebbe fare anche un lavoro più articolato, collegando i singoli schemi e/o dati alle ontologie agid.

Sono a due livelli differenti. Può esserci l'API ""Muoversi in Lombardia"" con stato ""stable"" in generale, ma un metodo ""/droneManage"" in versione ""alpha"" ed il metodo ""/carriola"" in ""deprecated"".

totalmente d'accordo, va spostato negli schemas. Il parser lato server può comporre tutte le informazioni relative alla privacy scorrendo le informazioni sulla privacy dei dati che vanno trattati direttamente nella definizione dei dati stessi.

+1

  - `method`: ok
  - `url`: ok a duplicare la stringa. Si potrebbe anche usare il server templating di OAS3. Vedi magari qui se ti viene qualche idea migliore. https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/ 
non vedo criticità in nessuna delle ipotesi.

@stefkohub fai tu la nuova PR dove chiudi questo punto.

Fai tu PR non devi fare merge delle mie modifiche.

generalmente d'accordo, ma devo capire come marcare i metodi in alpha in maniera `standard`.
Ti faccio io un commento per domani

Esatto, e le indicazioni potrebbero essere addirittura prese dall'ontologia agid: per questo è importante usare ove possibile quei riferimenti ed uniformare progressivamente i glossari.

The current behavior is printing only those accounts that are found and writing on the CSV/XLSX all of the websites no matter if the account was found. Now, we need two variables instead of one in order to say if we want to print it all and if we want to save it all on the file. This way, the current behavior is maintained and you can personalize the printing and the writing on the file.

I kept the same name to make the minimal changes possible but it may be more intuitive to change the name of 'print_found' to 'export_all' or 'write_all'. I could do that if you think is better.

We can keep it as it is for now. I'll think more about this and make changes if I feel if thats needed. I will make sure to credit you 👍

Maybe we could create `pkgContext` one time outside the loop and the `stmt.step()` instruction will move the data to the next row by itself

Thanks for the suggestion, I did something similar, but couldn't define SQLite::Statement as constant, since some of the member functions seem to not have the const identifier. For that reason, I use std:ref instead of std::cref.

Are you asking why it's nested or why it's defined when there's only one caller?

The short answer is to initialize var loadState when it's declared.

I'm asking why put the logic in a function rather than just having it inline.

Are you saying that function is only called once rather than each time the load function is invoked?

I think it's for the current page only, not for the history.

Also, instead or relying on `DOMSubtreeModified` event, you probably just need to setup a time interval `setInterval()` to update the preview each 2-3 seconds when the preview is visible and remove it when the preview is closed.

Example: https://codemirror.net/demo/preview.html

I am not sure ALL actions will have this preview feature, basically just `SendEmail`. Add an attribute called `supports_preview = False` in base `Action` class (shuup/notify/base.py) and set it to True in `SendMail` action. Once that is set, you probably can use it to check whether to add a preview here or not.

Yeah, if this is applied somewhere else I don't see a reason to not have it here too.

Me neither, but for the sake of keeping the same behavior, I don't see a reason to remove it.

Are you sure this class exists on any of the table headers? If there isn't a class name identifying `IP Address` in the html, you'd have to add one for this to work.

If you do add it use an underscore `ip_address` as CSS classes can't have spaces.

This is right clicking in chrome on a date header and clicking inspect. It shows `class=""date""`.

When I do the same on anything with an IP I don't any unique class.

The reason I tried IP Address as a table header is when I import the headers from the table I get something like:
""Hostname,IP Address,OS,Architecture,Kernel Version,Reboot required,Puppet Version""
So IP Address must be a header so I wrote th.IP Address

For the Inventory page I can select the `th` for IP Address with this:

    $(""table"").find(""[aria-label^='IP Address']"")

It says find in table where `aria-label` starts with 'IP Address'.

I can see them as headers when I try the sorting on inventory.

```suggestion

And then you have to add the translation to translation files. e.g:

      fields: {

And also a translation:
```yaml
    users_media: {
      name: ""Medien"",
      image: ""Bild"",
      preview_unavailable: ""Vorschau nicht verfügbar"",
      fields: {

```suggestion

With this fallback image:
```js
import BrokenImageIcon from ""@material-ui/icons/BrokenImage"";
```

Tooltip:
```js
import { Tooltip } from ""@material-ui/core"";
```

In this case I would set `imgURL` to `null` if it is not an image. Otherwise `Avatar` would try to download / show the ""not image"" and creates a 404 request.
```js
                    imgURL: record.media_type.startsWith(""image"")
                      ? `${localStorage.getItem(

                      : null,
```

The `Tooltip` text:

This is related to goal! Note how the suggested refactor above negates the need for this check. 

Good work making these instance methods

Note that you have this function in goal_routes and task_routes. Consider making a separate file with shared helper functions and importing them where you need them to DRY up your code.

Great use of a helper function. You might consider also including the creation of the goal in `valid_goal` such that the function either aborts because of Invalid data or returns the goal instance.

This could be a nice place to use a list comprehension.

We should probably double check that the task ids in the request body actually correspond to existing tasks. We can do that with a `get_or_404` or a check on whether the task is None. 

Also note that `add_tasks_to_goal_dict` does the work of creating a list of task ids. That list has already been handed in as part of the request body, so this extra work is not necessary.

Just like with goal, consider using `valid_task` to return a task instance.

Nice work querying the database to make sure the change was persisted there.

Great helper!

Great work, the use of helper functions and get_or_404 in this function really streamline the code!

Storing this result of function call here in a variable (ie `task_ids = self.list_of_task_ids()`) and then testing could create a slight optimization, because then the variable could be used on line 19 (`""task_ids"": task_ids`) instead of calling the function again.

They are not accessible from the functional interface search insights provides. I'm leaning into retrieving the `userToken` and persisting it in memory in order to reapply it each time.

Why not map and spread instead of mutating?

Anything to do for v5?

map/spread would be a better implementation indeed

Not sure. it's coming from [this util](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch/blob/master/packages/instantsearch.js/src/lib/utils/getAppIdAndApiKey.ts) in instantsearch.js. @Haroenv do you know if the `transporter` is different in v5?

v5 uses transporter too

I might backtrack from this, the plugin doesn't know the app id and the api key. We can discuss in RFC if we can justify a change in the lib to make it aware of those credentials.

And if this is the case how I can identify which i18n json file belong to which language. Is there any fast way to do this or I have to manually check each i18n json file to check which language it belongs to. Looking forward to your response. Thanks.

please check the `i18n` command on `package.json` files.

You'll use with `I18n.t('YOUR TEXT')` and run the command, that command will create the line on i18n files.
