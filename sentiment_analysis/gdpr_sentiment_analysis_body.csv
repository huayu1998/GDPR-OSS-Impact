### 笞呻ｸ� Description *

The cordova-serve module suffers from remote code execution caused by the lack of validating dataDir & URL input arguments before executing the command in [#L89](https://github.com/apache/cordova-serve/blob/bbe740cd70dc31f91537864b39a8569d394205f0/src/browser.js#L89). The proposed fix will add a check for both inputs.

### 捗 Technical Description *

According to cordova-serve documentation `dataDir` & `URL` are described as:

_dataDir - a data dir to provide to Chrome (can be used to force it to open in a new window)_
_url - the url to open in the browser_

Types of the parameters
```javascript
@param url: string, dataDir: string
``` 

For the `dataDir` input I added a regex check which will make sure that the input doesn't contain any illegal character (which can result in RCE). If the validation fails it will print an error message


For the `URL` input I simply used `encodeURI` function which will encode the input as URL and give it to the chrome. If any extra command were added it will still be considered as a part of URL

[Acra](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra) is a network encryption proxy to protect databases and database-based applications from data leaks, allowing greater security for distributed applications via cryptography and intrusion detection.

Acra has honeypot generation tool as part of suite, they call it ""poison records"". Poison records are the records specifically designed and crafted in such a way that they wouldn't be queried by a client application under normal circumstances. Yet poison records will be included in the outputs of `SELECT *` requests. 

Upon passing AcraServer, they will inform it of untypical behaviour. The goal of using poison records is simple 窶� to detect adversaries trying to download full tables / full database from the application server or trying to run full scans in their injected queries.

## Acra is not only a honeypot generator

- Acra allows to selectively encrypt sensitive records with strong multi-layer cryptography in client-side application. Client-side app doesn't have _decryption_ key, thus compromising app won't lead to stealing key and decrypting data in the database.
- Sensitive data is encrypted before being transmitted to the database, and decryption key is not stored on client side.
- Data is decrypted in trusted environment (on AcraServer).
- Acra allows to detect potential intrusions and SQL injections (using SQL firewall and poison records). 
- Works with PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.
- Has SIEM integrations.
- Suits for distributed, microservice-rich environments.
- Has numerous examples and tutorials for many languages.
- Allows your application to cover GDPR articles 25, 32, 33, 34.

ActiveRecord 4.2 includes virtual attributes in selects with joins. This raises an error because virtual attributes are not persisted and there's no column with the name to the virtual attribute.

```
ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: SQLite3::SQLException: no such column: people.county_plaintext ...
```

### Background:
ActiveRecord 4.2 uses a slightly different implementation of Attributes API than in 5.0+. Before ActiveRecord 5, this API was considered private (although technically it wan't). In ActiveRecord 5+, the issue was fixed (by accident) because of the significant refactoring that took place in ActiveRecord and ActiveModel.

Some of the issues with virtual attributes in AR 4.2 were fixed with the addition of a new property called `persistable_attribute_names`. https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/5383f22bb83 When checking for dirty attributes for example, they use that instead together with changed model attributes (which include the virtual ones as well).

### Proposed Solution
For now we can override the `column_names` method of `JoinPart`, which the `JoinDependency` uses to generate aliases for the joined tables.

I'm subscribing (and after deleting) a dummy member to the list if it is empty to get those fields, but that is done every time yo access the settings screen.

A good improvement would be to store those settings in the plugin options, but I don't have time now for adding that. If you don't accept the PR because of that I'll understand it. Probable in a week or so I'll have more time to make that improvement.

My name is Jeff Marckel, and I have a considerable amount of experience as a C programmer on Linux systems that I would like to share back with the community.

This PR focuses on ""PID checking and Instance Locking"" that I feel should cover at least 2 open issues.

   https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/3892

   Here a user sees that a pidfile not tied to a running process can still
   block a new instance from starting. I believe that this is likely a case
   of #407, noted below, but some testing is required to exclude other issues.

   https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/407

   Here it is seen that pid re-use is an apparent vulnerability, where an
   unrelated process that just happens to get the pid that rsyslogd last used
   can block a new instance from starting.

In either case, the correct approach is to rely on using `fcntl()` to pass a `struct flock`, where any exclusive lock held by the dead process would be cleared by the system, meaning custom pid detection logic can be removed from the rsyslogd code entirely. From a brief examination of the code, it seems that there is also a race condition between checkStartupOK() and the creation of the actual pidfile in writePidFile(), which could pose a risk of multiple instances.

I implemented and have tested these changes, added a test to cover multiple instance startup of rsyslogd, and then used the new features of the lockfile to cross check the pidfile functionality in tests/diags.sh. I verified my testing on Travis. 

The pid validation function does not yet cause any tests to fail, but maybe that would be a good idea to turn on, but I did not know if it might cause problems for other tests. I have spot checked all tests I can and see good results. I am also thinking I will do more to take advantage of the lockfile to clean up diags.sh further, in terms of killing hung processes in a future PR. Feedback is welcome. 

Thank you,

Jeff

### 噫  Objective
This is an update to the `/package` endpoint. The endpoint's behaviour on `master` is to return the first level dependencies.
The goal of this change is to also return the list of sub-dependencies for every dependency until we reach the ""bottom level"" dependencies.

### ｧｪ  Testing
- The tests run as part of the CI pipeline (肌 **to do**).
- To run them manually: `npm run test`
- You can also use your browser / Postman by sending a `GET` request to: http://localhost:3000/package/react/16.13.0

### 沈 Storage
**肌 To Do**
Given that `getPackagesRecursively` uses both a loop and a recursive call, we have an `O(n^2)` time complexity (quadric time).
Meaning calling the endpoint is expensive - especially since we're making a network call at every cycle. To avoid re-calculating the results every time, a storage solution is recommended.

##### Criteria
- Read heavy.
- Updates performed at regular but scheduled intervals (we'll invalidate a record if it's requested but is older than X hours).
- Data stored is non critical and doesn't contain sensitive elements (user data, GDPR requirements, no need for encryption...).

##### Possible solutions
1. Cache-like tool such as Redis. This will allow us to store records representations as objects and serve them from memory.
2. Static files and CDN. Probably the cheapest option and also very fast. Store the results in simple JSON files served as static assets from a CDN.

##### Improvements
Keep an index of most requested packages in a simple, traditional RDBMS to use for potential cache warm up.


### 柏 Security
**肌 To Do**
##### 1. Graph breadth and depth
We don't know in advance how wide and deep the dependency tree is going to be, yet we need to traverse the entire graph to be able to return all transitive dependencies.
This is a significant challenge as we could potentially use up an unlimited amount of resources to reach the bottom nodes (time complexity problem described above).
To prevent that from happening, we could implement:
    **a.** A depth counter for each branch and warn the user when a branch has reached its maximally allowed depth (and stop the recursive calls there).
    **b.** A literal time counter that would stop the execution in case we reach some type of time threshold.

##### 2. API throttle
As it stands, our endpoint allows an unlimited number of calls. This poses a risk of abuse as an attacker or zealous user might overload the service by sending a large amount of `GET` requests in a limited timeframe.
In order to mitigate the issue we could implement:
    **a.** Place a set limit of requests per second / minute / hour... per IP or other traffic attribution method.
    **b.** An API key requirement that would work in conjunction to the API throttle but maybe offer higher quotas.

### 操 Visualization
The results are presented as a dependency tree (represented as JSON) with currently no limit as to how deep the branches can go.
We have a top level object (the initially requested dependency). Each node contains the dependency's data, including an array containing the child dependencies of that node.
```json
{
  ""name"": ""a"",
  ""version"": ""1.0"",
  ""dependencies"": [{
    ""name"": ""b"",
    ""version"": ""1.0"",
    ""dependencies"": [{
        ""name"": ""c"",
        ""version"": ""1.0"",
        ""dependencies"": [{
          ""name"": ""d"",
          ""version"": ""1.0"",
          ""dependencies"": []
        }]
      },

The idea is to check out my branch (on my version, [here](https://github.com/Andonome/LaTeX_EnglandWales_Templates/tree/gdpr) ) and if you like it, then accept the merge request.

Otherwise, it can be rejected, or we do discussion here, e.g. if something must be fixed before it goes into your main branch.

I've put up an example of the results [here](https://belgradecats.tk/share/data_sharing.pdf).

The contract's not finished yet, but you should check if that's the kind of thing you mean before I continue, then put down what else is needed here.",hi pull request gdpr template idea check branch version like accept merge request otherwise rejected discussion eg something must fixed go main branch put example result contract finished yet check kind thing mean continue put else needed,0.074,0.737,0.19,0.6369,,Positive,142

The NuGET package cloudscribe.Pagination.Models was used, and a new class PaginationPartial was created, so it could be used in the future for other classes. 

**Task 2**
The following solution was created: For each user, the operator has the possibility of deleting it ( via the External Contacts API) by clicking on the created ""_Delete_"" option on the Index View(). A new View was created (_Delete_) where the full details of the selected user are displayed and the operator can confirm if the deletion process should proceed or go back to the previous view. 

In case the operator chooses to delete, the method ""_DeleteConfirmed(id)_"" is called, and a HTTP request to the External Contacts API is done. Depending on the StatusCode the operator is either suggested to try again via a Warning message( due to internal error/instability of the API), or the view is returned to the Index() and an Error message is displayed ( in case the user does not exist in the API Contacts list) or a Sucess message of deletion. Furthermore, the user is actually deleted from the .JSON file so it does not appear in the Index() View anymore. 

**Task3**

Some Unit Tests were implemented via XUnit and .Moq where we assert some expectations such as a correct HTTP Request mock and correct return value. 

**Task 4**

To implement this functionality, I would add the option to Select multiple users on the Index View(), which when pressed a button, an event would be triggered. Inside this method, using a foreach loop , I would make a GDPR Request() for each user, via the HTTPClientFactory, since it takes responsibility for managing the resources that the clients can use up. This way, the low restrictive rate problem is mitigated ( which was also the reason why this approach was used for the Task2).",task nuget package used new class paginationpartial created could used future class task following solution created user operator possibility deleting via external contact api clicking created delete option index view new view created delete full detail selected user displayed operator confirm deletion process proceed go back previous view case operator chooses delete method deleteconfirmed id called http request external contact api done depending statuscode operator either suggested try via warning message due internal errorinstability api view returned index error message displayed case user exist api contact list sucess message deletion furthermore user actually deleted json file appear index view anymore unit test implemented via xunit moq assert expectation correct http request mock correct return value task implement functionality would add option select multiple user index view pressed button event would triggered inside method using foreach loop would make gdpr request user via httpclientfactory since take responsibility managing resource client use way low restrictive rate problem mitigated also reason approach used,0.073,0.854,0.073,-0.25,,,

## Description

This PR aims to adjust the CIS-CAT rules `0510-ciscat_rules.xml` according to changes performed at the mentioned issue.

* The field names have been updated by adding the `cis` prefix. For example :
  `field name=""result""` ---> `field name=""cis.result""`
* Both `cis:` and `cis-data` events have been unified under the same fields. It is mean the fields such as `cis-data.X` have been replaced by `cis.X`

## Tests

- [x] Generating CIS-CAT alerts such as `rule id = 87418`
- [x] Getting the appropriate JSON alert.

Problem -
Anonymize Ip feature was already exist based on configuration, it was anonymizing IP buut As per GDPR rule we will not store Ip address.

Solution

Delete existing IP addresses when the IP anonymization is turned on.
Warn the user that IP addresses will be anonymized. Show a big red box with a warning next to the ""Anonymize IP"" config option. Use the following warning text: ""Existing data will be anonymized. This action is not reversible"".
Do not store IP address if the feature is enabled

<!--

I've added plugin settings to let the user deny or allow cookies by a callback hook. A callback function is needed to enable or disable tracking, depending on the tracking system used by the website.  
The possibility to deactivate tracking is needed for the new GDPR.

I updated the underlying cookieconsent lib and used settings of this lib to deny/allow/revoke cookies.  
Additionally I set the version of this plugin to v0.5.0.

You can try it under https://blog.dmr-solutions.com/ (in german only) with buttons to allow or deny cookies in the cookie consent dialog. The cookie consent is used together with a Google Analytics Plugin, also extended with callback functions by me and coming soon as version 1.5: https://github.com/rluetke/grav-ganalytics.  
The state of the tracking is show by a checkbox under https://blog.dmr-solutions.com/impressum: scroll to ""5. Verwendung von 窶曩oogle Analytics窶�"" and look there for the checkbox.

You may revoke the cookie setting with a small link at the buttom of the browser window.

And while openstreetmap.fr provides all the metadata information, Geofabrik provides only version information (and no values for attributes like `changeset`, `user`, `uid`). Using such diffs for update_database results in database ""corruption"", as random values land in `changeset`.

As I've checked source code [node_start](https://github.com/drolbr/Overpass-API/blob/master/src/overpass_api/osm-backend/osm_updater.cc#L137), [way_start](https://github.com/drolbr/Overpass-API/blob/master/src/overpass_api/osm-backend/osm_updater.cc#L198) and [relation_start](https://github.com/drolbr/Overpass-API/blob/master/src/overpass_api/osm-backend/osm_updater.cc#L282) they create OSM_Element_Metadata object but `changeset`, `user_id` and `user_name` fields are not set if not provided in source. [Object constructor](https://github.com/drolbr/Overpass-API/blob/master/src/overpass_api/core/datatypes.h#L448) does not initialize `changeset` (and I guess that constructor depends on implicit empty string initialization for `user_name`), though `user_id` is.

I implemented client side conditional loading of scripts. The method is known from different cookie consent services like Usercentrics, CookieFirst and others (see https://docs.usercentrics.com/#/direct-implementation-guide or https://support.cookiefirst.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011566698--Change-website-s-scripts-to-comply-with-the-GDPR).

To use it, replace (or add if missing) `type=""text/plain""` and add `data-cookie-feature=""feature-identifier""` to your script tags that depend on user consent. No logic in PHP is needed.
When the user gives consent for feature `feature-identifier`, the scripts then gets loaded and executed. This check is also done on page load. If consent for a script gets withdrawn, the page will be reloaded to remove all code of those affected scripts immediately and completely.

This new feature is a completely optional addition, the plugins still works as before.

1. the state file being deleted upon imfile vanishing was not the state
   file with 'file_id'
2. when a imfile was renamed (e.g. after a rotation), the file was
   flagged with 'in_move' which resulted in the state file to never be
   destroyed

The state file was not destroyed because of the following sequence:
1. imfile is renamed, a IN_MOVED_FROM event is fired and 'in_move' flag set
2. polltree executes and finds the imfile is gone, hence deletes it
3. due to having 'in_move' flag, the state file isn't destroyed

Finally, not related to the issue, but close enough, the inotify 'wd'
descriptor was never deleted, causing an internal error to occur if a
rotated file was being modified.

The new code gets rid off 'in_move' flag completely, because it is
useless: upon file renaming, polltree will detect that file vanished and
will delete the entry after flushing.
The old code was anyway unreliable in the case more than 1 file was
being renamed in a given directory simultaneously: since polltree
executed as soon as first notification IN_MOVED_FROM was received, it
deleted the entry for the other files being renamed as well before the
'in_move' flag could have been set.

This pull request doesn't alter current forms submission behavior (in essence it ensures that the [`""forms.submit.before""`](https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit/blob/efb8944051d7f347a4114cd21d8f01ecab373a00/modules/Forms/bootstrap.php#L267) event is always triggered for each form submission).

A borderline example is shown below.

---

### Issue description:

When using a form call like the following:

```html
<form action=""/api/forms/submit/contact"" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">
  <input name=""files[]"" type=""file"">
  <input name=""submit"" type=""submit"" value=""Submit"">
</form>
```

empty `$_POST` data is passed to `Forms\Controller\RestApi::submit` causing an early exit from that function and without being so able to parse `$_FILES` data inside the [`""forms.submit.before""`](https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit/blob/efb8944051d7f347a4114cd21d8f01ecab373a00/modules/Forms/bootstrap.php#L267) hook

https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit/blob/efb8944051d7f347a4114cd21d8f01ecab373a00/modules/Forms/Controller/RestApi.php#L23-L34

### Proposed solution:

Set fallback param `$data` to empty array and delegate empty check validation to `Forms::submit` function.

```php
// Forms\Controller\RestApi::submit

$data    = $this->param('form', []);
$options = $this->param('form_options', []);

return $this->module('forms')->submit($form, $data, $options);
```

```php
// Forms::submit

$this->app->trigger('forms.submit.before', [$form, &$data, $frm, &$options]); // <-- parse here form $data request

if (empty($data)) {
  return false;
}
```

---

### Example of usage:

Dynamically check and populate forms `$data['files']` entry:

```php
// config/bootstrap.php

$app->on('forms.submit.before', function($form, &$data, $frm, &$options) use ($app) {

  // see ""Helper Functions"" for more info about it
  $files = get_uploaded_files()

  if (!empty($files)) {
    $files = $app->module('cockpit')->uploadAssets('files', ['folder' => get_forms_uploads_folder()]);
    $data['files'] = $files['uploaded']; // <-- save entries as filename
  }

});

```

### End notes

The **Contact Form** example reported above does not suffer from this problem because the variable `$_POST` is still populated by other input fields.

The **Upload Form** (with just input `$_FILES`) is purely demonstrative. It can be solved somehow by hooking the [`assets`](https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit/blob/efb8944051d7f347a4114cd21d8f01ecab373a00/modules/Cockpit/Controller/Assets.php#L54) api, however, it would be nice to be able to do it with the same hook (regardless of the number of parameters and without having to define custom rest api endpoints...)

I've attempted to preserve some formatting, but much of it hasn't made the transition / requires a bit of markdown-ification to look decent again.

Comments have been brought over and added as comments on the pull request, which means:

- if the pull request is merged, the comments will not come along for the ride; they could be recreated on the files if we see the need, otherwise they'll stay only within this PR view
- if the line referenced by a comment is deleted, the comment will be gone as well

so there may be room for improvements, but I don't see any problem with keeping this PR open as long as needed, so let's start trying out collaboration here and iterate as needed!",pull request markdown document containing proposal gathered onlyoffice document attempted preserve formatting much nt made transition requires bit markdownification look decent comment brought added comment pull request mean pull request merged comment come along ride could recreated file see need otherwise stay within pr view line referenced comment deleted comment gone well may room improvement nt see problem keeping pr open long needed let start trying collaboration iterate needed,0.037,0.894,0.069,0.34,,,

To do this we first change the data source for the design force and question/answer entries to a tab separated format (TSV). We favor this over CSV (commas, used often in fields) and JSON (more difficult to edit in plaintext). Spreadsheet editors can also import and export TSV (for Excel, through copy and paste as plaintext, though it adds some unnecessary escaping). 

We make the tool accessible from the homepage, following the same approach as the search functionality. It uses the site's CSS along with its own. It also uses its own javascript, to fetch the TSV data (or Google Sheets), and add elements to the page. Google Sheets functionality is merely commented out, and can be easily restored.

Currently, Orejime provides a non-useful ""accept"" button in a GDPR-compliant world. The initial pop-up has an ""Accept"" button, but this will only accept categories that are set to ""Enabled"" by default (which is not allowed by GDPR). 

So this PR would help fix that by presenting an ""Accept all"" button (similar to the button on the modal interface behind ""Learn More""). It is a configurable feature since it exposes a bool option in the orejime config object so the default behaviour can still remain.

It is as minimal as possible:
- OSM users can register services by submitting an URI for the service.
- OSM users can request an API key for each registered service.
- For a registered service there is a stream of new and revoked keys with a similar mechanism to the minute updates via the new API endpoint _third_party_services/keys_

The data held on the Main Db is
- a table of services where the URI is unique
- a ledger of keys, implemented as two tables where _third_party_keys_ hold the actual data and _third_party_key_events_ is used as a PG sequence to properly sort out create and revoke events

Tests with full coverage have been added. Please take the whole thing still with a grain of salt: I have little Rails experience.

  </ul>
  <h1>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h1>
  <p>We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.</p>
  
  <h1>What is GDPR?</h1>
  <p>GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the controlﾂ£the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>
  <p>The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers窶� data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p>
  
  <h1>What is personal data?</h1>
  <p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person窶冱 name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p>
  <p>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
  <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
  <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
  <li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h1>Why is GDPR important?</h1>
  <p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At my happy quote app we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p>
  
  <h1>Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</h1>
  <p>We are committed to helping our customers meet theﾂ£data subject rights requirements of GDPR. my happy quote app processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.</p>
  <p>We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We've been set up as self service from the start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data. Our customerﾂ£support team is here for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the API.</p>
  <h1>California Residents</h1>

This will introduce breaking changes in terms of SDK compatibility as well as API changes. It's currently work in progress but i already want to use this PR to discuss the API changes.

I created new docs under https://github.com/janvennemann/ti.admob/tree/MOD-2495/docs which represent the current state of the iOS API with Swift. There is a doc for each proxy containing detailed API references and parity info at the bottom. The main changes that i would propose for this module would be:

## Module
### Changes
- New method `initialize` to initialize the Google Ads SDK
- New method `createBannerView` to create banner views. I think this one is currently called `createView` in Android.
- New constants AD_SIZE_* to be able to specify different banner sizes.

### Parity notes
- AdmobModule.debugIdentifiers: currently iOS only. Can be added to Android via https://developers.google.com/admob/android/eu-consent#testing
- AdmobModule.isTaggedForUnderAgeOfConsent: property on iOS, method on Android
- AdmobModule.SIMULATOR_ID constant is missing on Android (https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/AdRequest.html#DEVICE_ID_EMULATOR)

## Banner view proxy

### Changes
- Ad will now be loaded via `load` and options can be passed for each load request.
- Ad size can be specified via the new `AdSize` proxy.
- Renamed events to be more JS'ish **BREAKING CHANGE**

### Parity notes
- Android: `loadAd` and `requestAd` can be replaced by `load`
- Android: All properties except for `adUnitId` and `adSize` can be removed. Ad request customization is done via `load(options)`.

The only breaking change so far on Android would be the event renaming. However this can be avoided if we internally map the old event names to the new ones. The old methods can just be deprecated and the new ones introduced alongside them.

## Description

SCA generates `checks` and `summary` alerts in the first scan.

Also, if DB is empty, Analysisd creates two alerts reporting the policy summary.  That's because the function `HandleScanInfo` requests the scan result two times.

### Description of the Change

* New DPO Qlik app, built to help (GDPR) Data Privacy Officers track data breach via exports and information where data sits. This application depends of 2 newly added extensions: DataReach and swr-sense-navigation.zip (fine tuned to accept up to 5 actions)
* Updated script parsing to recognize new LIB Connect statement
* Updated DataLineage extension to latest version with improved performance and mouse hover gui
* corrected issue that would send illegal chars to the XML files generation and would halt the collector execution
* Now recreates the userAccess and its containing folders structure (in case these were included in a manual delete)
* script parsing will also look into C:\ProgramData\Qlik\Sense\Log\Script by default to ensure non migrated to ArchivedLogs scripts are taken in account
* updated both Governance QVD Generator and Governance Dashboard for Qlik Sense applications to reflect the changes above
* squashed a bug that made users information in Governance Dashboard for Qlik Sense applications to be misrepresented

### Description
Set $this->parts to default value before attaching PDFs to email.

### Manual testing scenarios
1. Set Magento to send emails asynchronously (https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/sales/sales-emails.html);
2. Enable attaching Invoice PDFs (path: mp_email_attachments/general/is_enabled_attach_pdf)
3. Create first order by replicating issue in https://github.com/mageplaza/magento-2-email-attachments/pull/18 (for example, use ﾃ､ (umlaut) in the customer name);
4. Create second order;
5. Invoice first & second orders;
6. Wait for cron to send the emails OR run **sales_send_order_invoice_emails** cron with https://github.com/netz98/n98-magerun2

Without code changes from this PR, the second Invoice email will contain Invoice PDF from the first invoice.
This PR fixes this by setting $this->parts to the initial value.

LEGAL GDPR NOTICE:
According to the European data protection laws (GDPR), we would like to make you
aware that contributing to rsyslog via git will permanently store the
name and email address you provide as well as the actual commit and the
time and date you made it inside git's version history. This is inevitable,
because it is a main feature git. If you are concerned about your
privacy, we strongly recommend to use

--author ""anonymous <gdpr@example.com>""

together with your commit. Also please do NOT sign your commit in this case,
as that potentially could lead back to you. Please note that if you use your
real identity, the GDPR grants you the right to have this information removed
later. However, we have valid reasons why we cannot remove that information
later on. The reasons are:

* this would break git history and make future merges unworkable
* the rsyslog projects has legitimate interest to keep a permanent record of the
  contributor identity, once given, for
  - copyright verification
  - being able to provide proof should a malicious commit be made

Please also note that your commit is public and as such will potentially be
processed by many third-parties. Git's distributed nature makes it impossible
to track where exactly your commit, and thus your personal data, will be stored
and be processed. If you would not like to accept this risk, please do either
commit anonymously or refrain from contributing to the rsyslog project.

This PR implements the ""Remove"" task that will go through and remove/anonymize fields. When editing a field definition, and ""Right to be forgotten"" is set to ""Anonymise"", then a new Sanitizer dropdown appears. This uses the same sanitizer plugins available from the original gdpr_dump module. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90130/37348893-160b93cc-26cd-11e8-8734-118ce924c481.png)

For non-editable fields (such as base fields on User), these settings can be attached for now using hook_entity_base_field_info_alter:

https://github.com/FreelyGive/gdpr/blob/8a77cad40f5475083817155742e289e18c04d20f/modules/gdpr_tasks/gdpr_tasks.module#L203-L218

(Aside: We should be consistent with use of UK or US English for anonymise/anonymize, sanitise/sanitize etc) 

When viewing the task, fields are listed with their corresponding action: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90130/37349305-035519b4-26ce-11e8-993d-f0391164b679.png)

Once run, the ""Processed by"" field will be populated and a log will be created indicating which fields were affected and which sanitizer was used on them (this data should be backed up separately from the database backup and used as the basis of re-playing remove requests after a database restore). This will need to be tidied up at some point and probably moved to a separate tab. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90130/37350669-48df20a8-26d1-11e8-800f-281d900fdb0f.png)

If a field is set to anonymise, but no sanitizer is defined then it'll attempt to find the default for the datatype. At the moment, TextSanitizer is used for string fields and DateSanitizer is used for datetime fields. Others can be added by implementing the gdpr_type_sanitizers_alter hook:

https://github.com/FreelyGive/gdpr/blob/4a27249f4680ccc1f16f2460e1e1651aba56acd8/modules/gdpr_tasks/src/Anonymizer.php#L184-L191

A few things to note:
- I changed the interface declaration for GdprSanitizerInterface::sanitize to also receive an instance of the field which can be used for metadata purposes (eg calculating max length of the field). 
- The IDs for the sanitizers had a typo (gpdr_* instead of gdpr_*), which I've fixed but is technically a breaking change. 
- Introduced RandomTextSanitizer as an alternative to TextSanitizer and UsernameSanitizer. This generates a random string of a specified length prefixed by anon_. This is useful for sanitizing usernames as it shows it's been anonymized at a glance (while the original UsernameSanitizer generates usernames that don't 'look' like they've been sanitized).

REASON: this data could contain Personal Identifiable Information returned in queries from SFDC
Added logger.info to Request class to show which function was called.

*Issue #, if available:* #5 

*Description of changes:*

We found that Logging Level `INFO` is logging too much information, such as queries responses from SFDC requests, which ideally should be in DEBUG logging levels. The main concern here is that the data being logged contains personally identifiable information. Moving the request and response data to a `DEBUG` log level will allow users to exclude PII from their logs while using `INFO` and still be able to see what the lambdas are doing.  Should help the users that need to be GDPR compliant.

    allowing visitors to enable/disable / opt-in/out categorised a very good example www.cookiebot.com.
5. 403, 404, 500, 503 etc. Search and page could not be found should be easy to edit and follow the 
    theme this includes the pagination customisation.
6. Allowing a 302 and 303 straight from the dashboard.
7. Disable additional themes/templates/options/Kits that we don't want clients to use/have access neither from front, 
    back or ftp you maybe want to use plugin with API.
8. Theme, templates and options not be a part of the installation of builder it should be available just on Brizy 
    Library with a preview allowing us to choose whatever we would like to use (e.g. Have a plugin with 
    API could be the same one that we use to activate Brizy on that domain, the developer/designers 
    can install and delete it to help choosing a template required and once decided the plugin could 
    be deleted, removing rest of the template/options apart from the one chosen).
笶� 9. API Key handling Dashboard with management options.
 	笨蚤. Company name and URL as a company might have multiple sites (next to the key) to keep a track of which key is assigned to.
	b. Duration date that would have option to [Activate] | [Approval ( so that no one can use the key 
            out of our knowledge)] | [Deactivate] | [Delete]
	c. Search and sort filter.
	d. Can you please make an option that will give us control to make the Key for Master Key (for 
            multiple use) or Unique Key (for single use) restricted to a single user as we may not want 
            everyone using and sharing/distributing the key this could easily be done. 
	e. Notified (email/ text notification) when someone uses our master key and/or the Unique Key.
	f. **Do not** allow anyone to clone/migrate the site using the key unless we authorise from our 
	    dashboard. 
10.	Advance Search and sort filter front and backend.

Detta ﾃ､r imo en vﾃ､ldigt bra quality-of-life funktion som omedelbart lﾃｶser vﾃ･ra problem med mail genom att vi inte behﾃｶver skicka nﾃ･gra lﾃ､ngre. Anvﾃ､ndarhanteringen blir ocksﾃ･ kraftigt fﾃｶrenklad.

**OBS:** Denna PR ﾃ､r inte redo fﾃｶr merge till `master` fﾃｶre vi har avtalat med IT-avdelningen om att ansluta oss till SSO. Detta ﾃ､r dﾃ､rfﾃｶr ett proof-of-concept sﾃ･ vi kan diskutera om det ﾃ､r vﾃ､rt arbetet. Dessutom ﾃ､r min erfarenhet av Ruby inte jﾃ､ttestor sﾃ･ det behﾃｶvs review. Se nedan.

### Vad ﾃ､r SAML?
[SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) ﾃ､r standarden bakom Single Sign On i mﾃ･nga fﾃｶretag, dﾃ､ribland ocksﾃ･ Chalmers. Det blir alltsﾃ･ teoretiskt mﾃｶjligt med den hﾃ､r ﾃ､ndringen att logga in med CID i rﾃｶstsystem, fﾃｶrutsatt att IT-avd skulle godkﾃ､nna en anslutning.

### Hur kﾃｶr jag ﾃ､ndringarna?
Ni kommer behﾃｶver rebase:a ﾃ､ndringarna ovanpﾃ･ er arbetskopia. Fﾃｶr min fungerar det rﾃ､tt pﾃ･ master med en miljﾃｶ som liknar prod dvs. Ruby 2.5.3 i en Linux-miljﾃｶ. (Ni lﾃ､r behﾃｶva kﾃｶra en `bundle update` fﾃｶr att hﾃ､mta in nya dependencies.) 

Efter det mﾃ･ste ni migrera databasen, eftersom vi behﾃｶver ﾃ､ndra sﾃ･ man kan ha `nil` lﾃｶsenord.
Det verkar som `bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development` ﾃ､r tillrﾃ､ckligt fﾃｶr detta.

Fﾃｶr att sedan faktiskt logga in kommer ni behﾃｶva nﾃ･gon form av IdP. Eftersom ni antagligen inte ha en ""riktig"" sﾃ･dan konfigurerad i er testmiljﾃｶ har jag anslutit development environment till en [enkel serverless implementation](https://capriza.github.io/samling/samling.html) som duger fﾃｶr att testa logga in/logga ut iaf. Om ni omdirigeras med en riktig fﾃｶrfrﾃ･gan rﾃ､cker det att sﾃ､tta name identifier till nﾃ･got vettigt (om jag fﾃｶrstﾃ･r rﾃ､tt ger Chalmers IdP CID hﾃ､r, men det spelar ingen roll fﾃｶr detta fﾃ､ltet anvﾃ､nds inte egentligen) och SAML Attributes enligt
```
urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3=cid@student.chalmers.se
urn:oid:2.5.4.42=Test
urn:oid:2.5.4.4=Efternamn
```
. Fﾃｶr mer detaljer om SAML-fﾃ､lten frﾃ･n Chalmers IdP se [SUNETS specs](https://wiki.sunet.se/display/SWAMID/).

Ni bﾃｶr nu kunna logga in och kommer direkt fﾃ･ ett konto med bekrﾃ､ftad mail (eftersom den garanteras av IdP). Tidigare anvﾃ､ndare med samma mail ﾃ･teranvﾃ､nds (det ﾃ､r uppslagsnyckeln som anvﾃ､nds).

### Beskrivning av ﾃ､ndringarna
I princip anvﾃ､nds [devise_saml_authenticatable](https://github.com/apokalipto/devise_saml_authenticatable) fﾃｶr att lﾃ､nka in i den redan existerande anvﾃ､ndarhanteringen. ﾃ没riga ﾃ､ndringar handlar framfﾃｶrallt om att gﾃｶra den gamla inloggningen och UI fﾃｶr att ﾃ､ndra lﾃｶsenord/mail otillgﾃ､nglig. Jag vﾃ･gar inte radera all kod som hﾃｶr till det eftersom det skulle krﾃ､va omfattande manipulation av databasen, men jag kan mﾃ･la ﾃｶver ett lager och koppla loss de delarna av systemet sﾃ･ att sﾃ､ga. Pﾃ･ sﾃ･ sﾃ､tt bﾃｶr vi kunna migrera utan att allt exploderar i prod.

### ﾃв detta redo fﾃｶr prod?
Hjﾃ､lp gﾃ､rna till att testa lite om ni har mer tid ﾃ､n vad jag har. Skaffar vi bﾃ､ttre dokumentation skulle jag gﾃ､rna vilja snygga till sﾃ･ att vi faktiskt inte ens har kod fﾃｶr att logga in genom lﾃｶsenord i databasen. Dessutom ﾃ､r fﾃｶrstﾃ･s den stora punkten huruvida Chalmers IdP kan tﾃ､nka sig slﾃ､ppa in oss (vi behﾃｶver bara mail, fﾃｶrnamn och efternamn iaf). Jag hoppas att man skulle kunna fﾃｶrhandla direkt med dem sﾃ･ att vi kan ansluta fﾃｶr behﾃｶver vi gﾃ･ med i hela federationen SWAMID sﾃ･ kommer det vara ett helvete av GDPR och dﾃ･ kan vi kasta detta i soporna.",jag tittade igenom koden lite och implementerade saml sso detta imo en bra qualityoflife funktion som omedelbart problem med mail genom att vi inte skicka blir kraftigt ob denna pr inte redo merge till master vi har avtalat med itavdelningen om att ansluta os till sso detta ett proofofconcept vi kan diskutera om det arbetet dessutom min erfarenhet av ruby inte det review se nedan vad saml saml standarden bakom single sign chalmers det blir teoretiskt med den att logga med cid att itavd skulle en anslutning hur jag ni kommer rebase er arbetskopia min fungerar det master med en som liknar prod dvs ruby en ni en bundle update att nya dependency efter det ni migrera databasen eftersom vi man kan ha nil det verkar som binrails db migrate railsenvdevelopment detta att sedan faktiskt logga kommer ni form av idp eftersom ni antagligen inte ha en riktig konfigurerad er har jag anslutit development environment till en enkel serverless implementation som duger att testa logga inlogga ut iaf om ni omdirigeras med en riktig det att name identifier till vettigt om jag ger chalmers idp cid men det spelar ingen roll detta inte egentligen och saml attribute enligt urn urn urn mer detaljer om chalmers idp se sunets spec ni nu kunna logga och kommer direkt ett konto med mail eftersom den garanteras av idp tidigare med samma mail det uppslagsnyckeln som beskrivning av princip att den redan existerande handlar om att den gamla inloggningen och ui att jag inte radera kod som till det eftersom det skulle omfattande manipulation av databasen men jag kan ett lager och koppla loss de delarna av systemet att vi kunna migrera utan att allt exploderar prod detta redo prod till att testa lite om ni har mer tid vad jag har skaffar vi dokumentation skulle jag vilja snygga till att vi faktiskt inte en har kod att logga genom databasen dessutom den stora punkten huruvida chalmers idp kan sig os vi bara mail och efternamn iaf jag hoppas att man skulle kunna direkt med dem att vi kan ansluta vi med hela federationen swamid kommer det vara ett helvete av gdpr och kan vi kasta detta soporna,0.019,0.968,0.013,-0.34,,,

## Intention

We intend to hide checkmark related to saving credit card, as we present related copy and unselected checkmark on the previous screen due to GDPR requirements.
This means that user agrees to save card on the previous screen, thus, this checkmark is redundant and a business requirement is to remove it.

## Current solution

As other solutions would require API changes and there is no agreement whether this is the way to go long term, I've chosen to just include `Bool` flag which enables to override behavior which is based on `storeDetails`. This won't break one time payments, as in this case this UI is irrelevant.

## More proper solution

As `CardFormDetailsPresenter` is used within `CardPlugin`, which features `paymentMethod` which could be used to pass some information. This would require changes in `PaymentMethod` structure, changing API payload and adjust `shouldHideStoreDetails` based on `paymentMethod` details (like originally intended).

I have written a very basic login system for Puppetboard. The reason being that in my case, I am running puppetboard in a docker so I cannot use the authentication mechanism of apache/nginx/haproxy. With the new GDPR law coming next month, we have a new requirement that everyone needs a named account for all systems, this includes puppetboard.

In the absence of such system, I have decided to make it myself. The very basic PoC is this merge request. It is far from a finished product. The following items still need to be done:

- [ ] Add code/unit tests for the new code
- [ ] Add ""Add user"" modal to the users.html template
- [ ] Add ""Change password"" modal to the layout.html template
- [ ] Add password encryption
- [ ] Implement other storage backends besides SQLite
- [ ] Make the ""Edit"" and ""Remove"" icons functional on the users.html template
- [ ] Improve the HTML/CSS (I suck at CSS, I did my best)
- [ ] Perhaps implement groups with group permissions using ""Flask-Principal""
- [ ] Perhaps implement LDAP authentication with Group support
- [ ] Perhaps make it possible to change Puppetboard settings in the newly introduced ""Settings"" dropdown
- [ ] Make Travis happy

If you want to test my code, all you need to do is checkout my branch/PR and adjust the `default_settings.py` accordingly. You need to set `LOGIN_DISABLED` to `False`. When the app first starts up, a user is created with `admin` as username and `admin123` as password. Once you are logged in, 2 new menu bar items appear; Settings and ""Logged in as: ..."". See my screenshots below to get an idea.

The reason I am creating this PR is that I would really appreciate some feedback and ideas on how to improve it. Feel free to submit your own code.

Following are some screenshots of the UI.

- An option allows to disable per site settings. When this option is disabled, network settings replace default values.

By the way, a new option is added for the **see more** option. It adds the new `get_privacy_policy_url` support.

Short description of changes:

1. Added pagination
2. Implemented the new feature that allows the SuperPanel operators to do an GDPR deletion request. I'm using Polly for request re-trying in cases there are any temp issues with api.
3. Did some refactoring and added unit-tests
4. Currently, I did implement a simple way to send GDPR request for a batch of users by checking the checkboxes on the UI and call api in a loop. In a real-world scenario, I would also consider the following alternative approaches:
- a) store the checked users in a separate table and have a background task or service that will have its own scheduler for taking an amount of users and send them to api for gdpr. The result should be stored in same table and another UI process can check the table  for updating the user list in real-time. (Or just reload the updated users on page load/refresh if no real-time update is needed)
- b) as another alternative, I would consider using an out-of-the box message broker

Some work will need to be done to align/style these fields at some point. 

When completing the form, the agreement details are presented on the screen. The ""description"" shows as the label for the checkbox (if the agreement requires Explicit agreement).

This change adds a `registration-terms-and-conditions` authenticator.
It is disabled by default.
The authenticator allows to force terms and conditions acceptation during user registration.

Obviously, a realm allowing user registration is a prerequisite.

The authenticator must be first enabled in the required actions panel:

Then its requirement must be switched from `DISABLED` to `REQUIRED` in the registration flow:

## What is the purpose of the pull request

This is an important requirement from GDPR perspective. When performing deletion on a metadata only bootstrapped partition, users should have the ability to tell to clean up the original data from the source location because as per this new bootstrapping mechanism the original data serves as the data in original commit for Hudi.

## Brief change log

Create an option named hoodie.cleaner.bootstrap.source.file, when set it to true, users have the ability to clean the original source data. By default, it is false.

Also added corresponding unit tests for this option in TestCleaner.java.

#507 

### Description of the Change

Added an endpoint that supports deleting a user from a CNA organisation. This would allow CNAs to remove users from their CNA organisation who may have left their organisation.

DELETE /org/:shortname/user/:username -> CNA Admin or Secretariat

### Alternate Designs

The alternate design was to keep leveraging the update user endpoint to disable the user account however, this would lead to CNAs having to ensure the users in the CNA organisation are enabled/disabled correctly.

### Possible Drawbacks

None that I think of currently.

### Verification Process

I did manual testing as well as created tests to cover the endpoint.

### Release Notes

Added support for deleting users from a CNA if the requester is a CNA admin or secretariat.
